Less calling (nasal “ahhs”) today in colder/windier conditions, but proportionately shorter bills and legs, and smaller size/more compact blackbird-like shape were distinctive in direct comparison to the few mixing AMCR.

Crows, gulls, and starlings were coming to seed and bread that was left on Old Broadway street (apparently by the lone residence there) immediately adjacent to the railroad tracks. Max FICR count at one time was 16 feeding on the ground with 2-3 AMCR mixed in. Another 50 crow sp were along the tracks in the vicinity, the majority of which were presumably AMCR. Less calling (nasal “ahhs”) today in colder/windier conditions, but proportionately shorter bills and legs, and smaller size/more compact blackbird-like shape were distinctive in direct comparison to the few mixing AMCR.

It immediately sounded like a Fish Crow to me, with the higher pitch drawing my attention the most to it, so I stopped loading my gear to listen again.  Around 20 seconds later it gave the same distinctive call note again.  I pulled out my recorder and took some quick photos of the bird, but the bird flew off within 30 seconds, not vocalizing again.  Unfortunately, good profile views of it in flight were obstructed by trees in Thompson Circle.  The bird flew towards the Beach 11 area not looking like it was going to land there.  Lots of experience with Fish Crows in Cape May last March and some in other areas in the northeast and Texas.  A species continuing to increase its range.  Like other stationary counts from Gary, IN to Mexico, NY, a bird likely to be recorded every 1-3 years in spring flying along the ridge, with multiples in a spring likely to come in the near future.  Very curious as to how many of these will be in the interior of the park in the next decade though.",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.40,5,,1948,2447

We had heard that Fish Crows have shorter legs than American but had never had the opportunity to compare - they did seem shorter especially when they congregated on the asphalt. The birds were a touch smaller in appearance than the American Crows. Four at least in the median trees N of McD from which I eventually captured a few calls with moderate traffic.

The bird was very tame, allowing close approach and feeding on the expected urban detritus, including a road-killed small bird, a discarded roll, and various other quasi-food items. Several items were taken to a puddle where they were immersed in water before being eaten.    The bird vocalized a lot initially, always giving single syllabled ""ahh"" calls with a nasal quality. We left ten minutes later when the bird flew south and we pursued it.

A really cool experience, considering this crow barely looked my way even though I was close. I observed the crow eating something in the snow.

The heavy beak, spatulate tail, and bristle feathers on the beak all now suggest Common Raven.  Yet, prior to my photographing the birds at East Rock, I heard two Fish Crows calling in the immediate vicinity. The photos are of two different corvids raiding the Trowbridge Drive gate trash can. Their size, as apparent to me at the time, was not consistent with raven but was with Fish Crow. While the photos also suggest smaller corvids than ravens, some of the features want to shout out raven! The closed mind can play curious tricks. Time to check out museum specimens of Fish Crow to confirm that my brain settled on the correct identification.",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.33,3,,3536,5304

Small-billed. Several nasal FICR calls heard, much quieter than the one or two AMCR calling occasionally. Foraging and resting and preening. Allowed me to approach closely and make careful comparisons. Photos sent to crow expert, Kevin McGowan, who confirmed that almost all of the birds in my photos were FICRs. He based this on the short legs, small feet, and the distinctive to him, face and bill profile, as well as the wing formula on flying birds. Although I did not actually see an American Crow in the field, I heard at least one, and Kevin thinks that two birds in my photos are American Crows. So, I assume that I missed a few and am reducing the number of FICRs to a conservative 90.",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.33,3,,1509,2499

First Allegan Co. record, if accepted. Full documentation to be submitted to MBRC.   Circumstances: At 10:16 AM I began to hear 3-4 single note vocalizations to my east, which I immediately recognized as Fish Crow based on having heard them hundreds to thousands of times throughout the southeast (especially in Florida), but also SC, AR, MO, NJ, OH, and in Berrien Co. MI. I am fully aware of the similarity of juvenile American Crow vocalizations, and every call I heard was instantly recognizable as the classic single note of Fish Crow. The note was ""tinny,"" hollow, and higher pitched than that of American, without any of the harsh or grating tones, and was not variable or suggestive of whisper song, as one often hears from juvenile Americans. By the end of the encounter, which lasted just over a minute, I heard single vocalizations over ten times, though I didn't specifically count them, and the vocalization was consistent and classic for Fish Crow. I didn't hear any double notes.   Upon turning and looking in the direction of the first calls, there was a tight, cohesive flock of 5 crows wheeling roughly NW, and coming from the SE, and the calls were clearly coming from this flock. They were all the same size, with no individuals appearing larger or smaller than the others, and no American Crow vocalizations were heard at any time during the observation. American Crows, which were omnipresent throughout the rest of the day, nearly always vocalize. This is not proof that none of the 5 weren't Americans. But my suspicion is that all five were Fish Crows. However, I am only claiming one individual, on the basis of the fact that I never clearly heard two Fish Crows vocalizing at the same time, and that the birds identifiable as Fish Crows in my photos, and not provably different individuals. Conservatively, therefore, I am only claiming one Fish Crow.  As the 5 individual crows came closer, they passed directly overhead, within probably 50-100', when I was able to get excellent photos of one of the birds at close range (the best three photos are the same individual), and farther photos of what may or may not be another individual than the first one. In each of these photos it is very straightforward to see that p9 is longer than p5, which eliminates American Crow, in which p9 is shorter than p5.  Immediately after they passed overhead, and continued northwesterly toward the lakeshore, both Tomas Pedreros and I (the only two birders present) attempted to get sound recordings, Tomas using the video feature on an iPhone and myself using Voice Recorder on an iPhone. Frustratingly, although we heard several more calls, they do not appear to be audible in either recording. The birds continued northwest until out of site, and were not heard or seen again despite us staying on site until 1:30PM.",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,5.00,2,,708,2123

Found with a flock of American Crows harassing a Red-tailed Hawk. When they were all perched on the wire single file it stuck out like a sore thumb with how much smaller it was than the Americans. The legs appeared a bit shorter as well, and I was able to get a photo of it in flight with an American that actually shows the shorter legs. When it flew it had a bit of a noticeable difference in flight style, but I wasn’t really thinking at the time to take much note of that and focused more on securing photos of the wing shape and primaries. I was able to get photos that showed the longer central primaries which gave the bird more of a pointed wing shape than the more rounded shape of the Americans. Though not diagnostic on its own, I did notice that it seemed a little more glossy and colorful when the sun hit it than the other Americans around it. I tried to stay on it the flock flew off but they soon disappeared heading south along Kenny Road.",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,5.00,2,,1800,2880

These birds were mostly coming in groups of 5-15, and at least 75% of these birds early were calling, making for easy IDs. With 4 stragglers my count sat at 291 (already good for a personal high count, besting the Great Hill mid-summer roost in Weymouth).   However, right as I was about to leave, I heard a much larger flock flying overhead, and raced back to get a better vantage to count them. This pulse of 401 passed in a few minutes, and I strained to keep up my 1x1 tally and not resort to estimating or counting by 5s or 10s. There were then more birds streaming for the next half hour, but at a slower rate that allowed for easier counting (and separating out the handful of American Crows that were coming by at this time).   This count of 1177 obliterated the previous Norfolk County high count set just this month (480 on 11/1/23 at Noon Hill), and is a new high count for the South Shore. There is one Barnstable County count of 1200 in February of birds coming in to Falmouth from Marta's Vineyard (https://ebird.org/checklist/S65273943); otherwise this count is the highest count for the state away from the Lawrence Crow Roost. Even there the high count on eBird for Fish Crows is ""only"" 1500 (not including a 10,000 count that seems to be a mistake), though I'd imagine a great deal of estimating between the species counts is required there. This is also the new high count for the state during the fall (or indeed any month but January/February). This is all a long way of saying this was an incredible showing and I'm glad I started counting 1x1 right away!  Showing my work: First two streams earlier in the walk: 141, 146, 4  2:35pm: 401, 36, 35, 164, 66, 26, 9, 16, 34, 42  3:10pm: 43, 4, 3, 1",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.00,3,"",3343,5016

In downtown Saugtauck - first reported yesterday at this on Water St between Mary and Lucy yesterday by Martin Blagdurn, including a recording which sounded exactly like FICR, hence my attempt to chase it. I found this individual at the same location, however when I found it it was alternating between what I interpret as normal Fish Crow vocalizations (the single note, never the double note, as all Fish Crows in Michigan do) and American Crow calls. From the beginning of the observation the bird appeared consistently smaller-bodied than American Crow, with a noticeably dainty and decurved bill. In all of my photos of it in flight, P9 is clearly longer than p5, given as diagnostic of Fish Crow in the literature. Neither Pyle or the Handbook of Avian Hybrids lists any published or suspected hybridization events involving Fish Crow. However, one wonders if a lone Fish Crow vagrant which reached this area might hybridize with Americans when that is the only available option. Active flight feather molt at p7 shows that this is an after hatching year individual, and molt timing favors Fish Crow, which molts on average at this latitude a month later than American Crow (which finishes in Sept while FICR finishes in October).   Recordings:   https://soundcloud.com/user9140545/fish-type-crow-saugatuck-mi-9112022?si=f75482fc34f443f9bdc0cf670b96b774&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing   https://soundcloud.com/user9140545/fish-type-crow-saugatuck-mi-9112022-b?si=f75482fc34f443f9bdc0cf670b96b774&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.00,3,,1531,2735

The heavy beak, spatulate tail, and bristle feathers on the beak all now suggest Common Raven.  Yet, prior to my photographing the birds at East Rock, I heard two Fish Crows calling in the immediate vicinity. The photos are of two different corvids raiding the Trowbridge Drive gate trash can. Their size, as apparent to me at the time, was not consistent with raven but was with Fish Crow. While the photos also suggest smaller corvids than ravens, some of the features want to shout out raven! The closed mind can play curious tricks.

It immediately sounded like a Fish Crow to me, with the higher pitch drawing my attention the most to it, so I stopped loading my gear to listen again.  Around 20 seconds later it gave the same distinctive call note again.  I pulled out my recorder and took some quick photos of the bird, but the bird flew off within 30 seconds, not vocalizing again.  Unfortunately, good profile views of it in flight were obstructed by trees in Thompson Circle.  The bird flew towards the Beach 11 area not looking like it was going to land there.  Lots of experience with Fish Crows in Cape May last March and some in other areas in the northeast and Texas.  A species continuing to increase its range.  Like other stationary counts from Gary, IN to Mexico, NY, a bird likely to be recorded every 1-3 years in spring flying along the ridge, with multiples in a spring likely to come in the near future.

Two relatively small crows, hopping around in the grass along the point in very typical FICR fashion. I was still unsure initially, so played a two note FICR call, which one of the birds repeated. Largely silent otherwise, except for more ""caw"" like calls at one point, but thinner and more nasal than AMCR.  Extended close looks gave me time to study them. Bill slightly shorter than AMCR. Twice they carried off chunks of food to the trees around the corner from the cormorant roost point, which I think is solid evidence of a nest back there.   Upon departing with food the second time, two AMCR came in to harass them, chasing close and giving nice comparison looks of the two species in flight.",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.50,2,,1601,2401

Brought to Narrows Botanical Garden on 70th street, which works closely with Wild Bird Fund, where it was immediately given private quarters. Had enough energy for a few big flaps, but was overall listless and did not resist being picked up at all. Looked nearly dead in the car, but immediately perched on a log when placed in an enclosure. Hopeful, but not optimistic. Silent, but appreciably small, slender, and long-tailed in the hand. Not in my possession and certainly not in the hand any longer than necessary. Possibly one of the birds that nest across the street in Shore Road Park, but could be a member of the Hoffman Island night roost as well.",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.50,2,,2443,1832

Crows, gulls, and starlings were coming to seed and bread that was left on Old Broadway street (apparently by the lone residence there) immediately adjacent to the railroad tracks. Max FICR count at one time was 16 feeding on the ground with 2-3 AMCR mixed in. Another 50 crow sp were along the tracks in the vicinity, the majority of which were presumably AMCR. Less calling (nasal “ahhs”) today in colder/windier conditions, but proportionately shorter bills and legs, and smaller size/more compact blackbird-like shape were distinctive in direct comparison to the few mixing AMCR. The flock eventually dispersed off to the NW when a train came through and did not return over the next 15 minutes.

I first saw a Fish Crow (eventually there were 2) in a vacant lot with something big in its bill. I eventually realized it was an egg that it had dug out of the ground. It then flew over to a house’s gutter and appeared to wash the egg in the water in the gutter and then crush it (I wasn’t close to the house, so I’m not positive what was going on).  It then flew off to a nearby tree, presumably to feed young maybe? This happened several times, so there were multiple eggs buried. Here are some photos, including one of the hole where the eggs came from (I saw at least 3 holes).",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.50,2,,1578,1431

Two relatively small crows, hopping around in the grass along the point in very typical FICR fashion. I was still unsure initially, so played a two note FICR call, which one of the birds repeated. Largely silent otherwise, except for more ""caw"" like calls at one point, but thinner and more nasal than AMCR.  Extended close looks gave me time to study them. Bill slightly shorter than AMCR. Twice they carried off chunks of food to the trees around the corner from the cormorant roost point, which I think is solid evidence of a nest back there.   Upon departing with food the second time, two AMCR came in to harass them, chasing close and giving nice comparison looks of the two species in flight.",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,3.67,3,"",2000,3000

I watched it soar and go a bit away, and then slowly it returned calling and landed (out of site) in some neighbouring trees. I ran inside and got my camera and binoculars and by that time my brother was home. Not long after, the three American crows started attacking the FICR, which gave for a good comparison and very distinctive difference in behavior.

As the bird moved around the earth looking for food it appeared to me to be smaller and the legs gave me the impression of being longer. As well the tail appeared to be more rounded. Josh Vandermeulen who lives nearby has reported hearing and observing Fish Crows near his residence. While nesting nearby was a possibility I am not sure if this individual was a hatch year bird. Up to this point the crow I was viewing had remained totally silent but on lift-off gave several short nasal arruk, arruk, arruk arruk calls.

This bird did make single croaks, but then later it made repeated awps. We think the audio was consistent with Fish Crow.","11:30-1:30 pm.  ""Mid-day Crow.""  This bird made a repertoire of sounds, came and went repeatedly, and appeared to have a narrow beak, which for some time had us thinking we were seeing both a Fish Crow and a Tamaulipas.  It made its typical Fish Crow uh uh.  Later it came back and made single croaks and a repeated series suggestive of a Tamaulipas.   But on close examination of the photos and audio tape, we now think we were just hearing the same Fish Crow in a variety of moods and lights, including the awp awp awp awp.  The frayed tail had a slight wedge shape to it.  The small crow was glossy greenish black. The greenish color seems very consistent with photos of TC on the internet. There was a tiny pinkish area at the base of the mandible.    The location was on the Gulf side of the Highway, in the Treasure Island neighborhood dumpster station.  This experience suggests to be cautious of the single croak calls without an audio recording.  Having the cellphone recording is very helpful in sorting this out, as well as photos showing the tiny pink dot on ""both"" birds at the base of the mandible.  Further communications from local expert confirmed this as Fish Crow.",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,3.67,3,,2172,1553

After grabbing my camera and binoculars we started trying to relocate it. Shortly after, we heard its nasally ""cah"" calls coming from the back of our neighbor's property. Earlier Cyrus heard it making their more distinctive ""eh-uh"" calls. After waiting/searching a little longer we spotted it loosely associating with a group of three American Crows. It was clear the American Crows didn't like the Fish Crow being here, they were constantly chasing/attacking it in flight and scared it off of perches when it landed, but it was still persistently trying to tag along with them. It was very fascinating to watch. When the crows were in flight, the minor structural differences were easier to see. The Fish Crow had an obviously longer tail, more pointed/slender-looking wings, smaller head, and was overall slightly smaller. I got an in-flight photo that shows the comparison fairly well.",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.00,2,,1570,2603

These birds were mostly coming in groups of 5-15, and at least 75% of these birds early were calling, making for easy IDs. With 4 stragglers my count sat at 291 (already good for a personal high count, besting the Great Hill mid-summer roost in Weymouth).   However, right as I was about to leave, I heard a much larger flock flying overhead, and raced back to get a better vantage to count them. This pulse of 401 passed in a few minutes, and I strained to keep up my 1x1 tally and not resort to estimating or counting by 5s or 10s. There were then more birds streaming for the next half hour, but at a slower rate that allowed for easier counting (and separating out the handful of American Crows that were coming by at this time).   This count of 1177 obliterated the previous Norfolk County high count set just this month (480 on 11/1/23 at Noon Hill), and is a new high count for the South Shore. There is one Barnstable County count of 1200 in February of birds coming in to Falmouth from Marta's Vineyard (https://ebird.org/checklist/S65273943); otherwise this count is the highest count for the state away from the Lawrence Crow Roost. Even there the high count on eBird for Fish Crows is ""only"" 1500 (not including a 10,000 count that seems to be a mistake), though I'd imagine a great deal of estimating between the species counts is required there. This is also the new high count for the state during the fall (or indeed any month but January/February). This is all a long way of saying this was an incredible showing and I'm glad I started counting 1x1 right away!  Showing my work: First two streams earlier in the walk: 141, 146, 4  2:35pm: 401, 36, 35, 164, 66, 26, 9, 16, 34, 42  3:10pm: 43, 4, 3, 1",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,3.67,3,Molting,2380,3568

Soon, they all took off to the Hannaford parking lot where someone had dumped out, what looked like, a pile of whole-kernel corn.  Even though dozens of gulls were crowded around the site, the fish crow was able to grab some bites before the corn was all gobbled up by the gulls.  After the corn was gone, apparently some bits remained which the fish crow and and an American crow were feasting on.  The smaller size of the fish crow was quite noticeable compared to the larger American crow a few inches away.  Photos obtained.  The 1st photo is a close-up of the fish crow from only about 2 meters.

These are in addition to groups of Fish Crows and American Crows I just left - at I-64/I-264 interchange - about one half mile (west) from here.  Initially, I was headed to a church at dead end of Adderly St and Lucas Ave - to check for roosting crows. When I exited I-264E though, I detoured and pulled into Navy Federal Credit Union’s (NFCU) lot - first because of the overwhelming sounds of Fish Crows; but then because there were so many crows on the ground! Once I pulled into the NFCU parking lot, the crows' vocalizations escalated. I could hear American Crows too. The sky was dark; but I also became aware of larger quantities of crows in the tree tops. And then I noticed them on on the rooftops. I drove around all 4 sides of the credit union - to determine the extent. The crows were on the ground, treetops and rooftop on all 4 sides. The adjacent Marriott hotel had more crows - again on the ground, in the treetops and on the very large roof. I drove in and around other nearby buildings to quantify the extent. I came up with 3,288:  1,218 crows on 7 rooftops, 1) Navy Federal Credit Union, 2) Marriott, 3) Cross Road Center (counted 168 crows at 6:19 AM when they had already started leaving), 4) 7-11, 5) Chartway Credit Union, 6) DroneUp and 7) 156 Newtown Road. Crows did not use rooftop of Denny’s - perhaps because it’s a singe story - or cooking smoke was venting from roof.  The Marriott roof is quite large and had several hundred crows. Estimating other 5 buildings had 150 crows each.  600+ on utility cables. From the Cross Road Center parking lot, I started counting crows on the utility lines on this west side of Newtown Rd. When I got to 200, I estimated there were at least 600 crows total on the utility lines on Newtown Road.   720 in treetops - Crows occupied at least 16 treetops at NFCU. With 20 crows each that’s at least 180 crows, but some trees had more/50. Estimating 6 trees x 6 other business with 20 crows each.  250 on the ground at Navy Federal Credit Union (all 4 sides), behind, Marriott and behind Cross Roads Center.  500 in the sky. As the sky began to lighten, I became aware of steady stream of crows flying east.  I estimate 3/4 of the 3,288 were Fish Crows and 1/4 were American Crows. This is based on my initial impression when I arrived and recorded vocalizations.  -In hindsight, I realize I did not check east (behind DroneUp, 156 Newtown or 7-11), the Mexican place or Holiday Inn north of DroneUp or north of Greenwich Rood and I-264. - - - 2,200 on Curlew Dr (2024 Feb) https://ebird.org/checklist/S160654354  1,900 at Newtown Rd (2023 Nov 9) https://ebird.org/checklist/S154056403 3,000+ on Newtown Rd (2023 Nov 5): https://ebird.org/checklist/S153798632 2,500 over Berkley Bridge (2023 Jan): https://ebird.org/checklist/S126835401 1,300 on Hicks Ave (2021 Jan 2): https://ebird.org/checklist/S78529530",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.00,2,,3024,4032

Earlier Cyrus heard it making their more distinctive ""eh-uh"" calls. After waiting/searching a little longer we spotted it loosely associating with a group of three American Crows. It was clear the American Crows didn't like the Fish Crow being here, they were constantly chasing/attacking it in flight and scared it off of perches when it landed, but it was still persistently trying to tag along with them. It was very fascinating to watch. When the crows were in flight, the minor structural differences were easier to see. The Fish Crow had an obviously longer tail, more pointed/slender-looking wings, smaller head, and was overall slightly smaller. I got an in-flight photo that shows the comparison fairly well.",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.00,2,,2244,3942

At 6:55am on May 8, 2022 from the Prince Edward Point Bird Observatory parking area I observed a crow flying south above Long Point Road. The bird called several times, emitting a nasal ""gah"" note, sounding a bit like a cheap party horn. I called out ""Fish Crow!"" and Phil Mercier (Bander-in-Charge) and Jess Daze (Deputy Bander) emerged from the banding station and were able to see and hear the bird. Mercier recorded the bird's call. After the initial sighting the bird headed east over Lake Ontario towards Timber Island but then swung back and circled the bird observatory/lighthouse area several times. The crow was present for at least 5 minutes and called 15/20 times. Photographed by me. Recorded by Phil Mercier (initially as eBird incompatible AMR file but now uploaded as a MP4 thanks to the technical expertise of Kyle Blaney).",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,4.00,2,,2333,3500

It had a steeper forehead and less of a neck compared to the American Crow perched above.,"Photos,  audio.  See general checklist comments above for more details and background.  Over six hours I had five encounters with the Fish Crows with a total of about 20-25 minutes of observation.  They were very vocal during the encounters, both on the ground and in flight which made it easy to locate them.  They were seen near American Crows at times but never associating with them and if an American got too close they would aggressively drive it away.   Observations and comparisons were the following.  The Fish Crows had a short and chunky/squatty appearance when perched and while walking on the ground, compared to large, sleek, stretched-out look of the Americans Crows.  The Fish Crows gave single note “uh” calls and double-note “uh-uh” calls, where the duration was short and abrupt.  American Crow juveniles when begging make longer single note calls and never do a double-note.  Also, none of the American Crows were making begging calls.  Whereas the American Crows had a scaly appearance to the feathers on their upper backs, the Fish Crows appeared to have a smooth appearance.  When I could do a direct size comparison (Fish Crow chasing American right behind it) there was an obvious size difference with the Fish Crow appearing much smaller.  The Fish Crow wing shape was more pointed with P9 similar in size or slightly longer than P5.  The American Crows were more blunt-ended in shape with P9 appearing shorter than P5.  The Fish Crows at times appeared to have no necks since they would fluff up their throat feathers whereas the Americans would stretch their necks out, especially when calling.  When the Fish Crows called, they assumed a more hunched over posture whereas the Americans were more upright and stretched out their necks at a higher angle.  The Fish Crows did not associate closely with the American Crow flock but would sometimes be near the flock.

These birds were mostly coming in groups of 5-15, and at least 75% of these birds early were calling, making for easy IDs. With 4 stragglers my count sat at 291 (already good for a personal high count, besting the Great Hill mid-summer roost in Weymouth).   However, right as I was about to leave, I heard a much larger flock flying overhead, and raced back to get a better vantage to count them. This pulse of 401 passed in a few minutes, and I strained to keep up my 1x1 tally and not resort to estimating or counting by 5s or 10s. There were then more birds streaming for the next half hour, but at a slower rate that allowed for easier counting (and separating out the handful of American Crows that were coming by at this time).   This count of 1177 obliterated the previous Norfolk County high count set just this month (480 on 11/1/23 at Noon Hill), and is a new high count for the South Shore. There is one Barnstable County count of 1200 in February of birds coming in to Falmouth from Marta's Vineyard (https://ebird.org/checklist/S65273943); otherwise this count is the highest count for the state away from the Lawrence Crow Roost. Even there the high count on eBird for Fish Crows is ""only"" 1500 (not including a 10,000 count that seems to be a mistake), though I'd imagine a great deal of estimating between the species counts is required there. This is also the new high count for the state during the fall (or indeed any month but January/February). This is all a long way of saying this was an incredible showing and I'm glad I started counting 1x1 right away!  Showing my work: First two streams earlier in the walk: 141, 146, 4  2:35pm: 401, 36, 35, 164, 66, 26, 9, 16, 34, 42  3:10pm: 43, 4, 3, 1",Corvus ossifragus,fiscro,Species,21346,,3.33,3,"",2451,3681

May have been in fight or is sick or ate something poison.  Confirmation on Species came from Bruce Purdy & Bruce Hallett after several measurements sent in for verification. The crow passed away on 10/10 in the evening.  The bird is now in a freezer and is being transported on ice to Elsworth Weir BNT on 10/14/2015 for further transport to Univ of Florida.  Measurements are as follows: Length&#61;13 inches/34mm from tip of bill to tip of tail.  Culmen and or head&#61; 3"" or 7.5mm from back of skull to tip of beak.  Wing is 11"" from bend of wing on ruler to tip of longest primary.  Wingspan is 21 inches however not sure if I am spreading wings out correctly or enough.  TAIL is 6 inches. Foot is 4mm  excluding claw.  Bill is 4mm.  TWO MORE MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN BY REQUEST OF BRUCE HALLETT ON 10/12.  Tarsus Length&#61; 1 3/4 inches or 3.5 cm. Vernier Caliper reading is 38mm.  BILL from nostril opening anterior side to end of bill&#61; 1.2 or 1.3 "" inches respectively.  FINAL SYNOPSIS FROM BRUCE HALLET READS: The popular North American field guides list the Fish Crow as smaller in size, smaller billed and with shorter legs along with its call as being distinguishable traits when compared to American Crow.  You did some measurements  with a flexible ruler as best you could on your crow which was now a refrigerated specimen.  Lying the bird on its back, you took a measurement from the tip of its bill to the tip of the tail for length.  It showed 13 "" but was probably a little longer because the head and bill were not stretched out.  Fish Crows are listed as around 15"" long whereas Am Crows are listed as around 17.5"" which gives a nod to Fish Crow. Next, at my request, you measured the distance on the bill between the nostrils or nares and the tip, a hard measurement to take without the proper equipment.  Your take was between 1.2 and 1.3 inches which translates to around 30/34 millimeters and according to Peter Pyle's book Identification Guide to North American Birds Part I (1997) falls within the Fish Crow parameters of 25.7-34.2 mm.  American Crow is 28-44.0 mm and that includes all the  smaller subspecies. Lastly,  you took a tarsus measurement based on Pyle's requirements, and you came up with 1.75"" which translates to 44.45 mm.  Pyle reads Fish Crow parameters as 41.5-49.6 mm and American Crow as 53.0-66.5 mm.  Tarsus measurement to Fish Crow. We did not perform this process Linda according to exact scientific specifications.  However, you took enough calculations, however crude, to determine that you had a smaller, shorter billed and shorter legged crow which suggests a Fish Crow.  So I think you can now back up yours and Duncan's observation with confidence and I believe you already have. Thanks for your timeliness and focused efforts.

The bird was very tame, allowing close approach and feeding on the expected urban detritus, including a road-killed small bird, a discarded roll, and various other quasi-food items. Several items were taken to a puddle where they were immersed in water before being eaten.    The bird vocalized a lot initially, always giving single syllabled ""ahh"" calls with a nasal quality. We left ten minutes later when the bird flew south and we pursued it.

This day, 9 Oct is the 2nd sighting with Duncan Millis in location of Nandana Resort in gravel parking lot , the bird appeared lame, sick or injured. Duncan and I captured and placed in back of his SUV and was transported to Linda Bird residence and provided fresh water and food. Overall the crow Very weak and lethargic. May have been in fight or is sick or ate something poison.  Confirmation on Species came from Bruce Purdy & Bruce Hallett after several measurements sent in for verification. The crow passed away on 10/10 in the evening.  The bird is now in a freezer and is being transported on ice to Elsworth Weir BNT on 10/14/2015 for further transport to Univ of Florida.  Measurements are as follows: Length&#61;13 inches/34mm from tip of bill to tip of tail.  Culmen and or head&#61; 3"" or 7.5mm from back of skull to tip of beak.  Wing is 11"" from bend of wing on ruler to tip of longest primary.  Wingspan is 21 inches however not sure if I am spreading wings out correctly or enough.  TAIL is 6 inches. Foot is 4mm  excluding claw.  Bill is 4mm.  TWO MORE MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN BY REQUEST OF BRUCE HALLETT ON 10/12.  Tarsus Length&#61; 1 3/4 inches or 3.5 cm. Vernier Caliper reading is 38mm.  BILL from nostril opening anterior side to end of bill&#61; 1.2 or 1.3 "" inches respectively.  FINAL SYNOPSIS FROM BRUCE HALLET READS: The popular North American field guides list the Fish Crow as smaller in size, smaller billed and with shorter legs along with its call as being distinguishable traits when compared to American Crow.  You did some measurements  with a flexible ruler as best you could on your crow which was now a refrigerated specimen.  Lying the bird on its back, you took a measurement from the tip of its bill to the tip of the tail for length.  It showed 13 "" but was probably a little longer because the head and bill were not stretched out.  Fish Crows are listed as around 15"" long whereas Am Crows are listed as around 17.5"" which gives a nod to Fish Crow. Next, at my request, you measured the distance on the bill between the nostrils or nares and the tip, a hard measurement to take without the proper equipment.  Your take was between 1.2 and 1.3 inches which translates to around 30/34 millimeters and according to Peter Pyle's book Identification Guide to North American Birds Part I (1997) falls within the Fish Crow parameters of 25.7-34.2 mm.  American Crow is 28-44.0 mm and that includes all the  smaller subspecies. Lastly,  you took a tarsus measurement based on Pyle's requirements, and you came up with 1.75"" which translates to 44.45 mm.  Pyle reads Fish Crow parameters as 41.5-49.6 mm and American Crow as 53.0-66.5 mm.  Tarsus measurement to Fish Crow. We did not perform this process Linda according to exact scientific specifications.  However, you took enough calculations, however crude, to determine that you had a smaller, shorter billed and shorter legged crow which suggests a Fish Crow.  So I think you can now back up yours and Duncan's observation with confidence and I believe you already have. Thanks for your timeliness and focused efforts.
