At another time there was a chase towards the tree and around it, but neither landed. At various times a male landed in the tree (and both were present for a few moments), but only once (near the end of my time) did one land and linger to check out many of the sap holes (and allowed for many photos). At another time one was very skittish at the upper holes (no photo) and left quickly. They may differ is details of facial pattern (red throat breaking through black surrounding line), and in details in size/shape of red nape patch, but I will need to check through all prior photos to see if I have photos of both.

I arrived with Darian still on the scene as the RNSA squabbled with 2 RBSA on the cottonwoods. After about 5-10 minutes of this they split up and did not see them again before I left. Darian mentioned that the birds would squabble, break up, and begin squabbling again on the same tree as the pin below.  The individual was a male with a red throat with a cleanly demarcated black band below it. Only one red spot behind the eye on the black behind the eyes, clean red forecrown (clean black on hindcrown), red on nape, white line behind the eye. Clean white line from above the bill with a tinge of red bleeding into it behind the eye, wrapping around the red throat and black breast band. Tinge of yellow below the black breast band in the white on the underside near shoulder spur. The red behind the eye and a little in the white below the eye seems to be within range for pure per Macaulay and Sibley. For RBSA hybrid would expect to see red bleeding into the black breast band and in the black on the face and head, but everything seems to be cleanly demarcated. Ruling out YBSA hybrid with the cleaner looking barring on the back, the incomplete black border around the red throat and overall cleaner look.  Last seen here: 45.481723,-122.651812",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.75,4,,3333,5000

Lifer!!  Easily found in the group of trees others are reporting it in (where my marker is placed, too). Look in the deciduous trees near a dip in the trail, by a large circular concrete thing on the ground between the trail and the houses. It flies back and forth in that stand of trees, creating/feeding on/defending its sap wells.  One of the most beautiful and handsome birds I've ever seen... Brilliant red throat and forehead, stately black bib, crisp black and white stripes on face, soft red smudges on nape (my favorite part, it was beautiful to look at!), two rows of barring on the back.  It makes incredible square sap wells, unlike anything I've seen before (I'm used to the Red-breasted's perfect little circular holes). It's also extremely territorial towards all birds who approach its sap squares, actively chasing away many relentless hummingbirds and one opportunistic RCKI. However, it didn't even cast a glance at the many barking dogs or curious humans that passed by.   What an amazing bird... I couldn't get enough of its antics, and watching it as it made its squares. Sometimes it would carefully run the side of its beak up and down a branch, not as though wiping it, but as though it was sensing where to peck next, for it would then start working on a square in that spot.   Truly remarkable!!",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.75,4,,1770,1347

A couple minutes later it briefly flew back to the cedar where I soon lost it. It had a red cap and throat. The belly was grayish and the back was mostly black with some white. It seemed to favor the Himalayan Cedar with all the benches around it. Soon after I lost the sapsucker, an immature male ANHU started drinking from the holes.

Lifer!!  Easily found in the group of trees others are reporting it in (where my marker is placed, too). Look in the deciduous trees near a dip in the trail, by a large circular concrete thing on the ground between the trail and the houses. It flies back and forth in that stand of trees, creating/feeding on/defending its sap wells.  One of the most beautiful and handsome birds I've ever seen... Brilliant red throat and forehead, stately black bib, crisp black and white stripes on face, soft red smudges on nape (my favorite part, it was beautiful to look at!), two rows of barring on the back.  It makes incredible square sap wells, unlike anything I've seen before (I'm used to the Red-breasted's perfect little circular holes). It's also extremely territorial towards all birds who approach its sap squares, actively chasing away many relentless hummingbirds and one opportunistic RCKI. However, it didn't even cast a glance at the many barking dogs or curious humans that passed by.   What an amazing bird... I couldn't get enough of its antics, and watching it as it made its squares. Sometimes it would carefully run the side of its beak up and down a branch, not as though wiping it, but as though it was sensing where to peck next, for it would then start working on a square in that spot.   Truly remarkable!!",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.33,3,,1930,1529

Red nape. Red throat bleeding over past malar. No black malar. Two bold white stripes on back. We were looking at the MacGillvray's Warbler when the sapsucker popped into view just below the MAWA. Diana noticed the sapsucker first. WHen I saw it, I could only see the front of its face poking out from behind the base of a small elm tree. I could see a bright red throat, bleeding into the malar. There was no black border to the red throat, a classic textbook Red-naped Sapsucker. The bird was initially along the inner loop trail, just south of the tower. It then flew into the large live oak on the SE corner of the main sanctuary, and then flew back. We then got good photos and were also able to see the red nape. The bird for the next hour moved around throughout the sanctuary, stopping briefly in the hackberry above the front drip by the tower. Later on, we saw it fly east out of the sanctuary into the open area.  We found it again in Tootache trees on the east edge of the open area of the sanctuary before it continued flying east.",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,5.00,2,,875,1167

Lifer!!  Easily found in the group of trees others are reporting it in (where my marker is placed, too). Look in the deciduous trees near a dip in the trail, by a large circular concrete thing on the ground between the trail and the houses. It flies back and forth in that stand of trees, creating/feeding on/defending its sap wells.  One of the most beautiful and handsome birds I've ever seen... Brilliant red throat and forehead, stately black bib, crisp black and white stripes on face, soft red smudges on nape (my favorite part, it was beautiful to look at!), two rows of barring on the back.  It makes incredible square sap wells, unlike anything I've seen before (I'm used to the Red-breasted's perfect little circular holes). It's also extremely territorial towards all birds who approach its sap squares, actively chasing away many relentless hummingbirds and one opportunistic RCKI. However, it didn't even cast a glance at the many barking dogs or curious humans that passed by.   What an amazing bird... I couldn't get enough of its antics, and watching it as it made its squares. Sometimes it would carefully run the side of its beak up and down a branch, not as though wiping it, but as though it was sensing where to peck next, for it would then start working on a square in that spot.   Truly remarkable!!",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,5.00,2,,1781,1390

Decided to drive through town looking for it and narrowed in on a nonnative pine on the side of the road that looked good for a sapsucker. Sure enough, there it was attending sap wells against the bark, but the red nape, back pattern, etc indicate RNSA.

If I take this into consideration, and since I didn't get a good view of the back of the bird to get an idea of the amount of white, I suppose then that I'm calling this a RNSA (as opposed to a YBSA) based on the white chin patch and the statistical likelihood that a RNSA would have a red nape.",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.50,2,,2877,2523

Seen downstream from bridge at Pescadero Creek Road where the creek bends to the left.  There is an obvious tree near the North bank that has been snapped off along the trunk leaving about 2-3m section of open trunk pointing straight up. The bird was in the tall trees behind the broken tree. I watched it for maybe two minutes before it flew off downstream around the bend for me. It stayed on the North side of the creek. After about 10 minutes, it returned to the same tree with the many closely-spaced drill holes. I watched it for maybe 10 minutes more and took many photos. As I was heading back upstream, I heard pecking close by.  The bird was maybe 10m in front of me pecking away at the top of a dead broken snag.  I took a few more poor backlit photos.  The head pattern is very striking. Red crown, nape, throat, and a small spot below and behind the eye that was not visible in the field. The red on the crown and nape are separated by black. There is a white eyeline beginning behind the eye and running to the nape. There is a stronger white malar line.  The red throat is crisply bordered by black and then white.  There is no red in the breast.  Vertical white stripe on the flanks is bold and clear.  Two vertical white lines on black back are obvious and somewhat spotty.  Underside is white with smudgy fine chevrons of black.",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.50,2,,636,954

(SOL Co.),38.5263974,-121.8006958,"",,Unspecified,"","",,,,,,,S81603714,"",,,,"Very likely a pure female Red-naped Sapsucker. This bird was first reported this morning by Roger Muskat. It is about a half-mile west of Pedrick Rd. on the south side of the creek and bridge. It favors a group of flowering fruit trees around (38.5262103, -121.8102338). I approached this spot and the sapsucker immediately flew out of the flowering trees along the edge of the field, flying towards the creek. It stopped briefly in a black walnut on the Solano side, where I was able to get one photo, before it flew across the creek into Yolo Co. from which I don’t think it returned (I never saw it again in the next hour of searching).   When I first saw this bird I instantly thought “OMG, this might be a pure bird!” (Having seen so many local sapsuckers go down the hybrid path). The back was black with two distinct white “red-naped rows”, more defined than I have seen before on any hybrid. The red nape was completely separated from the red crown, there was no bleeding whatsoever. The throat was red with a white chin (a feature shown almost solely in female RNSA), with no signs of red bleeding into the chest. The bird lacked a black breastband, which though strange could indicate that this bird is coming out of juvenile plumage, and at this date is admittedly something that could point to YBSA lineage. However looking online at many photos taken well with the normal range of RNSA, this seems to be a stage that RNSA females go through. I did not get a great view of facial pattern in person, but it seemed pretty good for pure RNSA, no signs of bleeding, limited black border on the throat, etc. My one photo seems to show the bird having a lot of white on the face, something that can be more characteristic of YBSA, but I honestly think my photo doesn’t show the exact ratio of white to black on the face (somewhat of a weird angle).   So in conclusion I think this very well could be a pure RNSA, and am at least temporarily posting it as such to get the word out. Hopefully others can follow up and get more photos and a conclusive identification can be reached. If this bird ends up being a hybrid RNSA x YBSA I will gladly change it to such, but I think it has a good shot at being a pure bird.",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.50,2,,1240,886

NP was on it in the previous reported location. Lines and colors in the head and face seem to match up well with RNSA. The age of the bird is in question - what seemed to be a brown wash resolved into more of a yellow in better light. On a softer note, the shelling or ticking on the sides of the breast is neatly developed and not muddy or incomplete. The white patch is well developed. And there is something going on in the coverts, there seems to be two different generations but woodpecker molt is all cattywampus. Peter showed up and we looked at it for a while, eliminated HY (though not 100%) and I didn't like adult and he suggested SY.  If anyone managed to get photos of the primary coverts (tiny, dark feathers, just sticking out from the white patch, at the base of the primaries) please send these along, you can crop just to that area. Unfortunately they are often covered by the breast feathers. Short video of it preening:  <a href=""https://youtu.be/2pxrdQQftkg"">https://youtu.be/2pxrdQQftkg</a>",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.00,2,,2400,1821

This bird was first reported this morning by Roger Muskat. It is about a half-mile west of Pedrick Rd. on the south side of the creek and bridge. It favors a group of flowering fruit trees around (38.5262103, -121.8102338). I approached this spot and the sapsucker immediately flew out of the flowering trees along the edge of the field, flying towards the creek. It stopped briefly in a black walnut on the Solano side, where I was able to get one photo, before it flew across the creek into Yolo Co. from which I don’t think it returned (I never saw it again in the next hour of searching).   When I first saw this bird I instantly thought “OMG, this might be a pure bird!” (Having seen so many local sapsuckers go down the hybrid path). The back was black with two distinct white “red-naped rows”, more defined than I have seen before on any hybrid. The red nape was completely separated from the red crown, there was no bleeding whatsoever. The throat was red with a white chin (a feature shown almost solely in female RNSA), with no signs of red bleeding into the chest. The bird lacked a black breastband, which though strange could indicate that this bird is coming out of juvenile plumage, and at this date is admittedly something that could point to YBSA lineage. However looking online at many photos taken well with the normal range of RNSA, this seems to be a stage that RNSA females go through. I did not get a great view of facial pattern in person, but it seemed pretty good for pure RNSA, no signs of bleeding, limited black border on the throat, etc. My one photo seems to show the bird having a lot of white on the face, something that can be more characteristic of YBSA, but I honestly think my photo doesn’t show the exact ratio of white to black on the face (somewhat of a weird angle).   So in conclusion I think this very well could be a pure RNSA, and am at least temporarily posting it as such to get the word out. Hopefully others can follow up and get more photos and a conclusive identification can be reached. If this bird ends up being a hybrid RNSA x YBSA I will gladly change it to such, but I think it has a good shot at being a pure bird.",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.00,2,,1240,886

I thought the head was unremarkable in size and that the neck was short and stocky, so this bird did not have a blocky appearance to the head that is typical of the local woodpeckers.  The body was plump and full chested, and the tail was about as long as the body without the head.  I further thought the primary projection was roughly comparable to the full length of the exposed secondaries, and that the wingtips reached at least halfway out the tail.  The legs were short and stout.  This was a boldly patterned and relatively brightly colored bird.  The forehead and crown were a bright crimson-red back to the nape.  Framing the red cap was a black line that extended along the edge of the crown from the base of the bill and over the supercilium before connecting across the junction of the crown and nape.  The nape was obviously washed with red, but I thought back of the neck was blackish and mottled.  The black that bordered the crown also extended down in front of the eye.  The white supercilium therefore began right above the eye, from which it extended back over the auriculars to their rear terminus at the red nape.  The solidly black mask was conspicuous and well-defined as it extended back across the auriculars to their rear terminus where it narrowed, but I think the black continued down the side of the neck.  Demarcating the lower edge of the mask was a white moustachial-stripe that extended diagonally across the face from the base of the upper mandible, under the eye and around the throat.  The throat was the same shade of crimson-red as the cap, and this color extended across the malar region to meet the white moustachial-stripe.  I therefore noted black in the malar region only as a narrow wedge that extended a short way back from the base of the bill.  The red also extended across the chin and out to the corners of the throat.  Demarcating the lower edge of the throat was a breast-band that was roughly crescent-shaped and mottled with deep buff on a black background.  I think the white of the submoustachial stripe continued around the corners of the breast-band, but I can really only be sure that some paler color demarcated this band.  The sides and flanks were pale gray with blurry, blackish streaks at the sides and on the foreflanks, but the markings on the lower flanks were more wedges if not V-shaped chevrons.  I am not now sure about the color of the belly below the breast-band, but I did not think it was bright yellow, and I am certain that the undertail coverts were white with black streaks along the outer edges.  The back and scapulars were mostly black but with diffuse braces of white with blackish mottling on either side near the demarcation between the back and scapulars.  The inner part of each wing was solidly black but there was a broad blaze or wide crescent of white along the leading edge of the each wing that presumably covered the outer few coverts.  The remiges were black with white barring, but I am less sure about the pattern on the inner secondaries.  My views of the tail were less than ideal, but from the side it appeared to be mostly if not entirely black.  I think the rump was white (at least along the edges) but it also seemed to have a few, blackish streaks.  I noted that the bill and eyes were both dark, but I failed to note their color more precisely.  I did notice that the legs and feet were a dingy gray color.",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.00,2,,1199,1841

As usual, in its same spot in same tree, a Peruvian (Calif.) Pepper tree, along immediate east side of the Santiago Street pedestrian bridge, on the north bank of Santiago Creek. The bird known to be present this season since at least 29 November, 2011. Got excellent views this time, with the bird at eye level and fairly close. Got nice pics this time. Bold black and white in face, with no red at all seen in the auricular area (black or white areas).  Red nape. Presumably same bird, as each year this bird seems to show both female and male features.  Red throat completely framed in black, except for a small area at lower corners, where red washes out (""interrupts"") the black frame. The red of throat also shows a narrow sliver of white feathering at base of lower mandible. The red interrupting the black frame is supposedly a feature of male RNSA, although the white chin area is more typical of a female (which should otherwise show a complete black frame to throat). Interestingly, at rest, or in ""concealment mode"", with its neck scrunched in, I could not see much--or almost any--black at base of throat, the black being just along the side of the throat to where the red washes it out at the lower corner. Then when it seemed to be at alert, like ready to flee, it stretched out its neck, which resulted in (or revealed) a broad black lower border to red throat patch, the black being quite prominent, like a bib.",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.00,2,,1444,1565

It had a distinct face pattern so it was not a Red-breasted (also seen in nearby trees).  It had an all red throat.

There was no black border to the red throat, a classic textbook Red-naped Sapsucker. The bird was initially along the inner loop trail, just south of the tower. It then flew into the large live oak on the SE corner of the main sanctuary, and then flew back. We then got good photos and were also able to see the red nape. The bird for the next hour moved around throughout the sanctuary, stopping briefly in the hackberry above the front drip by the tower.

Observed for ~30 min.    I observed a sapsucker fly across the road that immediately caught my attention as it had a lot of white in the back and looked very different than the expected Red Breasted.  It took a while to track it down, but once I located the trees it was favoring I was able to get great views.  Often perched for long periods in excellent light.  Several times it flew low overhead between trees on each side of road.  Initially I thought this might be a Yellow-bellied or a hybrid based on the amount of white on the back.  With good views I was able to see the following:  Black and white face pattern typical of species including extensive bight red throat with red along side obscuring any black border along the sides but clearly boarded black below between throat and belly; bright red nape patch and extensive red crown.  Back had two rather broad white panels with fine black barring separated by black in mid back. large pure white wing panels and much white in tertials, much white in rump and middle tail.  Pale below with black border below red throat, yellowish wash to breast/belly, flanks grayish with fine black barring. Obtained are few very poor digiscope photos through binos.",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.00,2,,3586,2690

Seen very briefly as it flew from the Himalayan Cedar to another tree. I caught a glimpse of the white rump and black back before I lost it. In the tree, I spied many sapsucker holes. After waiting for a few minutes, it flew back to the Himalayan Cedar where I took some photos. Soon after, it flew to another tree where I got a glimpse before losing it again. A couple minutes later it briefly flew back to the cedar where I soon lost it. It had a red cap and throat. The belly was grayish and the back was mostly black with some white. It seemed to favor the Himalayan Cedar with all the benches around it. Soon after I lost the sapsucker, an immature male ANHU started drinking from the holes.

I arrived with Darian still on the scene as the RNSA squabbled with 2 RBSA on the cottonwoods. After about 5-10 minutes of this they split up and did not see them again before I left. Darian mentioned that the birds would squabble, break up, and begin squabbling again on the same tree as the pin below.  The individual was a male with a red throat with a cleanly demarcated black band below it. Only one red spot behind the eye on the black behind the eyes, clean red forecrown (clean black on hindcrown), red on nape, white line behind the eye. Clean white line from above the bill with a tinge of red bleeding into it behind the eye, wrapping around the red throat and black breast band. Tinge of yellow below the black breast band in the white on the underside near shoulder spur. The red behind the eye and a little in the white below the eye seems to be within range for pure per Macaulay and Sibley. For RBSA hybrid would expect to see red bleeding into the black breast band and in the black on the face and head, but everything seems to be cleanly demarcated. Ruling out YBSA hybrid with the cleaner looking barring on the back, the incomplete black border around the red throat and overall cleaner look.  Last seen here: 45.481723,-122.651812",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,5.00,1,,3333,5000

Seen by myself and Sandy Kroeger my neighbor while photographing the RB Nuthatch. Strong and bold white wing-patch. Eliminated Yellow-bellied due to obvious red on top/black bottom color of nape. Also, eliminated YB Sap due to extensive red on throat and high upper breast. The red on the throat extended past the black malar region seen on a Yellow-bellied. Honestly I never saw or did either of the observers get picture of the back. So, I did not see the other distinguishing field mark of the two white vertical stripes which further eliminates YB Sap. Though, in flight did not give off a highly whiteish appearance from behind. Call was a more harsh sounding “waaaaah” type call. YB’s have more of a downslur at the end that isn’t so harsh. Called several times. Responded vigorously to recorded call call. My first impression of the bird was ""look for the red nape"" when I saw it. Luckily my neighbor and great photographer Sandy Kroeger was there to take the wonderful pictures. I have studied a lot in the last few hours after the sighting.

A closer look at some of the photographs suggest it is probably an immature male (older than a juvenile), as its black bib on the breast was incomplete. Appears unrelated to the female seen in June or the subsequent RBSA x RNSA hybrids. First seen  by m.obs at approximately 11:00AM, ~30m north of the wooden bridge on the west side of Beaver Lake, associating closely with several RBSA which seemed to have chased it out. Reappeared ~5 min just east of the bridge facing the lake, before disappearing into the woods north of the Lake Trail junction (last seen 49°18'15.7""N 123°08'28.3""W).",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,3.50,2,,1436,1436

The bird was present in the only cottonwood tree on the trail between Smith Visitor Center and the stone ruins of the old horse trainer's barn. It had been observed in the cottonwood on the two previous days. The cottonwood is directly across the trail from some fenced-in electrical equipment and a large clump of prickly pear cactus, just before you reach the ruins. The stone ruins are visible on the right side of the road just before you arrive at the parking lot adjacent to Smith Visitor Center. Thanks to Arman Moreno and Eric Carpenter, whose eBird reports and directions made it possible for me to see the bird.    Adult male yellow-bellied sapsuckers can rarely show some red on the nape. However, in the red-naped sapsucker, the red throat invades or completely covers the black border along the malar, and the pale markings on the back are whiter and more restricted. Female red-naped sapsuckers with maximal red on the chin and throat closely resemble the male yellow-bellied, but usually have white on the uppermost chin and a hint of red on the nape, as the bird that I photographed does; The bird that I photographed is an adult female red-naped sapsucker, distinguished most easily from the adult male red-naped sapsucker by the limited amount of red on her throat. Adult female yellow-bellied sapsuckers do not have red coloration on the throat. Another difference in the two species is that the spotting on the back of the red-naped sapsucker is more clearly organized into two rows, as it is in the bird that I observed and photographed.",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,3.50,2,,3000,2177

New location on the wooded trail, past the boardwalk which heads northeast from the monument, beyond the gazebos, near the little group of little benches in the woods. I think this is a different bird than the male previously reported at the Mexican Breastworks 15 (which I also saw several weeks ago). This woodpecker is clearly showing a red nape, but not an extensive one.  According to Sibley's second edition, Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers can also sometimes have a red nape, but that the red throat with white chin is a field mark indicating Red-naped female. This chin/throat combination shows up well in the bottom photo.  Lacks black frame around the red and white throat, also more compatible with Red-naped female. I put the photos in the flicker bird id help group and the feedback is for Red Naped. In summary, the combination of an obvious but small red nape and a white chin with red throat suggest Red-naped female, according to Sibley's 2nd edition page 313, The chin and throat features are inconsistent with Yellow-bellied.     Later note...Someone left me a Flickr note suggesting that the back is too messy for a pure Red-Naped and that it might be a hybrid.

The back pattern and the large amount of black in the face are within the range of a red-naped sapsucker. The only question is whether adult males can lack red on the nape (Sibley mentions the possibility for females). So I'm changing the ID from the original ID of yellow-bellied sapsucker to a red-naped sapsucker, while noting that it is possible there is some yellow-bellied ancestry involved.  Original description: Adult male. Absolutely no red on nape seen in the field, verified in photos. No red on face, red on crown and a reasonably large amount of red bordered by black on throat. Lemon yellow belly, messy black and white pattern on back. Silent. Not easy to separate from red-naped, but I'm leaning strongly towards yellow-bellied rather than red-naped. Multiple photos. Comments welcome!  I saw the bird on a sycamore along the fence of the RV park (Bonita Ranch RV campground), where an unofficial trail along the south fork to Bonita falls begins. The bird flew into the park after good views for several minutes. If anyone is interested in chasing this bird, this spot can be accessed by hiking along the creek (Bonita falls trail) from outside the RV park. The RV park itself is private property and may require an entrance fee.",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,3.50,2,,1538,2048

It had a distinct face pattern so it was not a Red-breasted (also seen in nearby trees).  It had an all red throat.  At first, the red seemed almost outlined in black but closer examination showed the black outline was not complete.  It had an obvious red nape.

Decided to drive through town looking for it and narrowed in on a nonnative pine on the side of the road that looked good for a sapsucker. Sure enough, there it was attending sap wells against the bark, but the red nape, back pattern, etc indicate RNSA.

Peter showed up and we looked at it for a while, eliminated HY (though not 100%) and I didn't like adult and he suggested SY.  If anyone managed to get photos of the primary coverts (tiny, dark feathers, just sticking out from the white patch, at the base of the primaries) please send these along, you can crop just to that area. Unfortunately they are often covered by the breast feathers. Short video of it preening:  <a href=""https://youtu.be/2pxrdQQftkg"">https://youtu.be/2pxrdQQftkg</a>",Sphyrapicus nuchalis,rensap,Species,11017,,4.00,1,,2400,1948

I was in the area today and decided to stop by. The bird was found easily, once I arrived at the picnic area (coords of John’s checklist - dirt road requires high clearance vehicle) I accidentally flushed it from a snag and then was able to watch it for a while as it moved up a Ponderosa. I’ve seen many hybrid birds so far this year, and this is the first bird with RN features that didn’t scream hybrid. I may be missing some more intricate detail that would put it in the hybrid zone, but it looks good to me when compared to photos of RN. Red on head confined to cap, nape, and throat, with black under cap, white eyeline stripe, black cheek, and white stripe connecting to the red on the throat. Light belly with ‘blurry’ dark mottling that gives it a grayish look. Red throat met a black patch on the breast. Photos will be attached in a couple minutes, if there are any visible marks pointing to a hybrid please let me know! I’m always happy to learn.

Its also worth noting this is an immature bird,because of the lack of a black shield on the breast, and the advanced plumage is also indicative of RNSA genes in the bird. So why not just a RNSA? Well, this bird is a probably a male because it has an all red throat, and male RNSA should have no or very little black border on the red throat against the malar, also they usually have at least a little red on the cheek, and a larger red patch on the nape. I have read that some female RNSA can have an all red throat, but have yet to see any real evidence of that, all I have ever seen have a white chin, and most female RNSA have more red on the nape as well.

My first impression in the field was a YBSA, because the red throat had a black border, yet it also had a tiny amount of red on the nape, which is possible in YBSA but more likely in a RNSA. Upon examination of the photo it shows the red partially bleeds into the black border, that and the small amount of red on the nape both support a hybrid YBSA X RNSA over a YBSA. Its also worth noting this is an immature bird,because of the lack of a black shield on the breast, and the advanced plumage is also indicative of RNSA genes in the bird. So why not just a RNSA? Well, this bird is a probably a male because it has an all red throat, and male RNSA should have no or very little black border on the red throat against the malar, also they usually have at least a little red on the cheek, and a larger red patch on the nape. I have read that some female RNSA can have an all red throat, but have yet to see any real evidence of that, all I have ever seen have a white chin, and most female RNSA have more red on the nape as well.

This individual seems to be more submissive in interactions with the hybrid bird, which seems to be more aggressive.  The hybrid seems to stick mainly to a couple of pepper trees directly up the bank above the golf course maintenance sheds, whereas the Red-naped seems to bury itself in the interior of the pepper trees a bit farther west (the same wooded patch where the Zonotrichia flock seems to shelter whenever flushed from the trail).

A hybrid would likely show some red.  However, the black band in the hindcrown of the bird is broken by red coloration, suggesting that there may be some RBSA blood in this bird. A typical RNSA would show a complete black band unbroken by red.  Perhaps this bird is a hyrbid, has some RBSA blood in its lineage, or just shows more wear on its feathers.
