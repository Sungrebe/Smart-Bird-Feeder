I just sat down with my back up against a tree and enjoyed the time spent with the visitor.,"Found the original one that was very vocal with the only description that comes to mind was that it sounds like short yips or yipping or short shrieking barks. When this one came down lower and went to perch. I had to find it! And when I did. There was a second Peregrine Falcon. I slowly walked with camera in hand long ways next to my leg and didn't' look directly at them. short peripherals to make sure they were still there. I sat down and started taking photos of the best looking one with the better setting for a photo. Twenty minutes had gone by and both started yipping and looking up. Managed to catch two more streaming and right into direction of the sun. Then a third straggler streamed above. My 2 blandair birds were getting ready to take off. And when they did they elevated very rapidly and had caught the same stream and were gone. The Peregrine Falcon is my all time favorite bird!",Falco peregrinus,perfal,Species,11997,,5.00,6,,932,1200

I kept a good distance away so it would be undisturbed while eating. I never approached it directly and wanted to make it feel comfortable with me being there. After it was done it flew to different spots and twice landed within 50 feet of where I was standing. I was not seen as a threat. Part of that is likely this juveniles innocence to the ways of people and part of that was the respect I showed it. I thought how great it would be if all wildlife could be comfortable around people.

Refuge staff have said that it isn’t one of the locally-hatched birds as it doesn’t have the proper leg bands. Having worked with Peregrines this past summer in Virginia, I can say that the immature birds are pretty hard to get close to once they are able to fly. I think it is exceptionally rare to have the opportunity to observe and photograph an immature bird at this distance. The weather was pretty gloomy when my friends and I stopped by the refuge on January 2nd, but the Peregrine was right where other birders had reported it and I was happy to snap off a few shots while we slowly toured the auto loop.  The other Peregrine was perched on the nesting tower.",Falco peregrinus,perfal,Species,11997,,5.00,4,,3456,5184

I kept a good distance away so it would be undisturbed while eating. I never approached it directly and wanted to make it feel comfortable with me being there. After it was done it flew to different spots and twice landed within 50 feet of where I was standing. I was not seen as a threat. Part of that is likely this juveniles innocence to the ways of people and part of that was the respect I showed it. I thought how great it would be if all wildlife could be comfortable around people.

This bird was insanely approachable; perched along the road on a guard rail. It’s not every day that you hear the words ‘friendly’ and ‘Peregrine’ in the same sentence. Refuge staff have said that it isn’t one of the locally-hatched birds as it doesn’t have the proper leg bands. Having worked with Peregrines this past summer in Virginia, I can say that the immature birds are pretty hard to get close to once they are able to fly. I think it is exceptionally rare to have the opportunity to observe and photograph an immature bird at this distance. The weather was pretty gloomy when my friends and I stopped by the refuge on January 2nd, but the Peregrine was right where other birders had reported it and I was happy to snap off a few shots while we slowly toured the auto loop.  The other Peregrine was perched on the nesting tower.",Falco peregrinus,perfal,Species,11997,,5.00,4,,2304,3456

The alarm resumed, and the falcon landed in a nearby palm tree. Eventually I walked on, leaving the falcon in the tree. About 10 minutes later I looked back and saw the falcon had returned to eating the coot on the beach.",Falco peregrinus,perfal,Species,11997,,4.60,5,"",3219,3219

The male is E39 (Perry) and the female is C94 (Rosalee). Here's the Chicago Peregrine Program information on her: Winter Wanderings-- Not all adult Peregrines stay near their breeding sites to winter. A few females seem to ""pair up"" with a wintering solo male and then return to their breeding site the next spring. We saw this in the winter wanderings of Rockford's Louise. Here it is again with a Chicago/Bensenville sighting of a falcon named Rosalee. Rosalee fledged from a site in Madison and breeds up in Rothschild WI. During winters she has periodically been caught on webcams and sighted by photographer/birders. Just this fall she had traveled from Rothschild, to Jefferson WI to Milwaukee and then to Chicago/Bensenville at the same location she was in Jan 2019. It may be that Chicago is her winter home and webcams just caught her making her way down south. And being a peregrine attracted to Peregrines, she was photographed with a male at each site.  (Before you make something into THAT - it is likely something as simple as finding a good hunting ground by following a resident falcon).",Falco peregrinus,perfal,Species,11997,,4.14,7,,3200,4800

For more information about project history, protocols and methods visit the projects official website: floridakeyshawkwatch.wordpress.com. For a complete yearly report, email taspublisher@gmail.com. All avian species as part of this project are monitored from two sites in the Middle Keys. At Long Key State Park, by morning flight surveys and transect counts each morning from September 1 through the mid-November, during which all detections are documented by distance, habitat use, behavior and number of individuals using standardized protocols. All avian species are monitored from Curry Hammock State Park (CHSP) during that same time period, in a daily sequence of 7 to 8 point counts, using methods standardized for the site and in use since 1996. Counts take place from 09:00 to 16:00 DST, and all bird detections are documented for species and number of individuals. Raptors are additionally documented to include age, sex and any other plumage or morphological details for each individual when detectable, in addition to flight direction, lateral distance, flight height and flight path; only southbound totals for the entire duration of the daily count per site are included here (CHSP minimum 7 hours each day). Every hour, wind direction and speed, temperature, sky conditions, flight details and observer information is logged into standardized forms.

I tried to figure out what it was by taking photos and looking for the remnants of the meal but couldn't tell exactly. It was a peep species but I don't know which one. I kept a good distance away so it would be undisturbed while eating. I never approached it directly and wanted to make it feel comfortable with me being there. After it was done it flew to different spots and twice landed within 50 feet of where I was standing. I was not seen as a threat. Part of that is likely this juveniles innocence to the ways of people and part of that was the respect I showed it. I thought how great it would be if all wildlife could be comfortable around people. I spent probably 20-30 minutes just getting lost in the moment. I felt like it was just me and the falcon on the beach.

This bird was insanely approachable; perched along the road on a guard rail. It’s not every day that you hear the words ‘friendly’ and ‘Peregrine’ in the same sentence. Refuge staff have said that it isn’t one of the locally-hatched birds as it doesn’t have the proper leg bands. Having worked with Peregrines this past summer in Virginia, I can say that the immature birds are pretty hard to get close to once they are able to fly. I think it is exceptionally rare to have the opportunity to observe and photograph an immature bird at this distance. The weather was pretty gloomy when my friends and I stopped by the refuge on January 2nd, but the Peregrine was right where other birders had reported it and I was happy to snap off a few shots while we slowly toured the auto loop.  The other Peregrine was perched on the nesting tower.",Falco peregrinus,perfal,Species,11997,,4.33,3,,2198,1558

Refuge staff have said that it isn’t one of the locally-hatched birds as it doesn’t have the proper leg bands. Having worked with Peregrines this past summer in Virginia, I can say that the immature birds are pretty hard to get close to once they are able to fly. I think it is exceptionally rare to have the opportunity to observe and photograph an immature bird at this distance. The weather was pretty gloomy when my friends and I stopped by the refuge on January 2nd, but the Peregrine was right where other birders had reported it and I was happy to snap off a few shots while we slowly toured the auto loop.  The other Peregrine was perched on the nesting tower.",Falco peregrinus,perfal,Species,11997,,4.33,3,,2987,4473

As it got closer, however, there were no dark axillaries on it and the mustache was too thick for PRFA - it was a Peregrine but looked pretty unique. I took distant photos and one digiscope video as well, but the bird was soon gone to the south.

I came down to clubhouse drive to scope the river, and just as I got into looking for ducks, I heard a primeval noise unlike anything I’ve really ever heard. I looked up to see a pair of ravens sitting on the famed OSFL branch and a very pissed off adult female PEFA soaring right next to them. Suddenly this bird dove at both the ravens, putting them up and then viciously going after them. The ravens and the PEFA were both vocalizing, and I realized that the combo of the hoarse Raven calls and some guttural PEFA calls were that odd noise I had initially heard. But the real show came when the PEFA decided to rip around the Landing, weaving in between houses and trees and staying quite low. I’ve gotten to experience many awesome moments with PEFAs, but this quickly topped them all because I can’t remember the last time I had one come flying at me eye-to-eye! Eventually, after various iteration of what I explained here happened a few more times, the ravens got tired and fled, and the PEFA claimed it’s perch on the OSFL branch. It remained undisturbed until a Bald Eagle tried to land on the branch, which led to the PEFA attacking and successfully chasing off the Eagle. Not a very birdy day but this compensated for it all! **Note: this bird was banded but I don’t think I got a read on the numbers",Falco peregrinus,perfal1,Group,11998,,5.00,2,,2820,1957

Not sure if that was yesterday's cache or freshly caught sometime ago. She fed for about 5 mins and tiercel P2 was not in sight. P1 took off after a brief feeding, went around the Block#1 and came back in a minute now overshot reaching the Block#2 NE perch. Not sure if P2 was perched on the southern face of Block#1, but he followed her and directly landed in to Block#1 East facing perch as if he knows there is something left in the kill.   P2 fed very briefly, within 2 mins took off from there and landed in the box below where P1 was perched. P2 vocalized a bit when he landed and both of them kept looking at each other for some time. P1 slept for a few mins as the closed yellow eyelids were clearly visible, but woke up after a Squirrel ran in the parapet wall of the terrace. At around 6:50, P2 took off making a quick flight around Block#2 and came back flying almost touching P1 with a lot of vocalization. P1 dodged a little but didn't bother any much as P2 continued to make a short soaring and landed in the same face on the western end perch.   A Three-striped Palm Squirrel had now climbed down from the terrace parapet into the window sun-shade where P1 had her kill in Block#1 and started feeding, possibly on the remains of the pigeon kill. It was quite surprising to see the rodent relying of the Peregrines to add some protein to its diet.   At around 7:05,P1 did a short wing stretch and pooped once. These are daily indications that she will take off sooner, that she did in less than an minute and took a short glide followed by quick flight towards west face of Block#2. As expected, within a minute P2 also took to wing and followed the same path of P1. A few feet walk revealed that both of them were perched next to each other on the west face of Block#2 at SW end perch.",Falco peregrinus,perfal,Species,11997,,5.00,2,,1687,2486

I kept a good distance away so it would be undisturbed while eating. I never approached it directly and wanted to make it feel comfortable with me being there. After it was done it flew to different spots and twice landed within 50 feet of where I was standing. I was not seen as a threat. Part of that is likely this juveniles innocence to the ways of people and part of that was the respect I showed it. I thought how great it would be if all wildlife could be comfortable around people.

First the Peregrine snaps the neck. The Peregrine was sort of mantling its food. We were watching it eat the Pigeon from behind tinted windows, so I don’t believe the Peregrine could see us watching it eat. I am posting this sighting about 4 years after making the initial observation, and taking the photos. Some of the photos show a leg band on the Peregrine. We got enough photos of the bird on the ledge as well as visuals, to be able to piece together the numbers on the the tag,  and look up the Peregrine in a database, As I recall, I think this was a female bird who was born on or near the lock and dam in  Minneapolis. I can’t remember exactly how old we calculated the bird to be at the time, but I want to say it was about two and a half years old at the time. All to this is based on my memory of the events 4 years later,  because I did not write down the info about the tag contemporaneously to making the observation. But it was quite memorable and stuck in my mind.On a separate occassion, we saw the Peregrine catch a Pigeon out of midair right in front of our eyes, 15 stories up. (This particular room of our office had a great big bank of windows, 20 feet by 20 feet.)

This eastern side of MDI has tall Pinus strobus and rock cliffs which are perfect places to hunt for food and protect the immature birds.

As we tried to walk down the trail to the van the adult female came toward us very aggressively and trapped us momentarily on the trail with an aggressive behavior I have not seen before for this species. Her aggressive approach and loud scolding was more Goshawk-like. When the adult started calling all 3 immature birds flew into a large White Pine which we passed by earlier and then initially found the birds. The trail is really the only way back to our van so we were stuck. At one point the adult bird flew close enough that we were forced to take cover behind a partial blow-down.  We waited in amazementbehind that tree for about 15 minutes when the female abruptly departed, I suspect, having assessed that we were not a threat.

After scanning the sky in vain, I saw a Peregrine Falcon sitting a few yards further up the beach, eating a coot. Gradually the ducks & coots started to go back to shore, then at 9:30 a runner went past the falcon, which flushed and circled over the water. The alarm resumed, and the falcon landed in a nearby palm tree. Eventually I walked on, leaving the falcon in the tree.
