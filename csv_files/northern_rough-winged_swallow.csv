We first watched him approach the nest hole on our deck with food, perch at the entrance to the nest hole, peer in, vocalize, and then fly out of sight for 10 minutes. He did this a couple times. A few other times he flew up near the nest hole carrying food and briefly vocalizing before flying off. We did not hear any begging calls coming from within the nest all day long. We did not see the female adult all day either. (The previous day, the young within the nest were incredibly vocal and loud, and the female was entering/exiting the nest every 5-15 minutes all afternoon, and the male was entering/exiting occasionally while the female was inside.)  As the afternoon went on, the male visited the deck and sat on a perch near the nest hole with food in his bill for 15-20 minutes at a time, constantly looking around him and occasionally vocalizing. He would then at some point eat the bug in his bill and fly off and disappear for a number of minutes, then return to his perch with new food. We observed him repeat this behavior over and over again for the duration of the afternoon.  We believed the nestlings to be deceased due to the lack of vocalizations and absence of the female adult. The male continued to visit and perch on July 4 and the morning of July 5. On the afternoon of July 5, we decided to clear out the nest hole because it was inside our dryer vent (we had not used the dryer since we noticed the female building the nest). The nestlings were indeed deceased - there were five of them. Four were intertwined in the nest itself and one was in loose nesting material behind the nest. While we were cleaning the remainder out, we set the nest with deceased nestlings on the deck railing. Several minutes later, the male circled nearby a couple times and vocalized. That was the last time we saw the male at the deck.  It was a joy to watch the nesting cycle from the start: From the male and female adults perching and scoping out our deck as a potential location, to the female gathering dry grass and fallen redwood twigs and needles from the road in front of our house while the male perched on the wire above keeping lookout, to the female carrying nesting material into the hole repeatedly while the male perched on the deck and kept lookout, to the female sitting in the nest for stretches of time while incubating, to watching her acrobatically swoop in circles just beyond the deck and enter/exit more and more frequently as the nestlings hatched, to hearing the nestlings vocalizations grow louder and stronger as each day passed. We are so very sad to not get the privilege of watching them grow up on the deck, and sad to speculate what may have happened to the female.  :(  We'll miss you, Billie Jean and Billie Gene &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3","We observed the male adult over the course of many hours. We first watched him approach the nest hole on our deck with food, perch at the entrance to the nest hole, peer in, vocalize, and then fly out of sight for 10 minutes. He did this a couple times. A few other times he flew up near the nest hole carrying food and briefly vocalizing before flying off. We did not hear any begging calls coming from within the nest all day long. We did not see the female adult all day either. (The previous day, the young within the nest were incredibly vocal and loud, and the female was entering/exiting the nest every 5-15 minutes all afternoon, and the male was entering/exiting occasionally while the female was inside.)  As the afternoon went on, the male visited the deck and sat on a perch near the nest hole with food in his bill for 15-20 minutes at a time, constantly looking around him and occasionally vocalizing. He would then at some point eat the bug in his bill and fly off and disappear for a number of minutes, then return to his perch with new food. We observed him repeat this behavior over and over again for the duration of the afternoon.  We believed the nestlings to be deceased due to the lack of vocalizations and absence of the female adult. The male continued to visit and perch on July 4 and the morning of July 5. On the afternoon of July 5, we decided to clear out the nest hole because it was inside our dryer vent (we had not used the dryer since we noticed the female building the nest). The nestlings were indeed deceased - there were five of them. Four were intertwined in the nest itself and one was in loose nesting material behind the nest. While we were cleaning the remainder out, we set the nest with deceased nestlings on the deck railing. Several minutes later, the male circled nearby a couple times and vocalized. That was the last time we saw the male at the deck.  It was a joy to watch the nesting cycle from the start: From the male and female adults perching and scoping out our deck as a potential location, to the female gathering dry grass and fallen redwood twigs and needles from the road in front of our house while the male perched on the wire above keeping lookout, to the female carrying nesting material into the hole repeatedly while the male perched on the deck and kept lookout, to the female sitting in the nest for stretches of time while incubating, to watching her acrobatically swoop in circles just beyond the deck and enter/exit more and more frequently as the nestlings hatched, to hearing the nestlings vocalizations grow louder and stronger as each day passed.

They have dark brown heads and backs and pale brown breasts.   There are no obvious contrasting, crisp markings and the birds are fairly plain.  These appear to be Northern Rough-winged Swallows.    Also considered was the Bank Swallow, which is similar in appearance to the Northern Rough-winged Swallow, but smaller.  One notable characteristic of the Bank Swallow, however, is the presence of a clearly defined, dark brown breastband which is absent in either of the observed individuals.  Neither of these birds have a breastband, but rather a dusky breast which fades into pale grayish white, which would eliminate the Bank Swallow as a possibility for identification.  The considered birds are also unlikely to be Tree Swallows as they do not have clean, white undersides or metallic blue upperparts.  In the unlikely case these were juvenile Tree Swallows, the underside appearance still does not jibe.  A sound recording at this location also confirmed the presence of Northern Rough-winged Swallows as the birds took to flight",Stelgidopteryx serripennis,nrwswa,Species,23876,,5.00,2,,1630,2173

It perched intermittently on the wire hanging below the silver exit chute of the dredge and hung around for a good hour before flying off towards mouth of the Nome River. Drab tan brown overall, pale dingy undersides, darker brown head that got more pale as it blended into the breast. No collar at all. Dark rump, not pale, ruling out Southern Rough-winged Swallow. Pointed it out to Dave Sonneborn and Gabi Sutton and they both agreed that it looked wrong for a bank swallow. Considered washed out weird young female Tree Swallow. Called over Marc Kramer, who got excellent photos to help with id. Photos were sent out to a bunch of experts, who all said that it looked good for Northern Rough-winged Swallow. That was fun. :)",Stelgidopteryx serripennis,nrwswa,Species,23876,,4.50,2,,3888,5184

Saw 1 perch for several minutes on a small, dead isolated shrub on an open bank of the stream in reach 4, ca 20 m from a vertical dirt bank and 50 m downstream of the red culverts. It perched here a few minutes, flew off, and then returned a short time later and remained for ca 9 minutes, from 0821 to 0830. At 0922 I saw 3 NRWS in flight at once, low over the stream in reach 3. 1 landed and made rough ""preh"" calls from a dead alder stub ca 20 m upstream of the single Betula occidentalis (noted as a landmark), then 1 landed on an alder stub ca 5 m NE of the B. occidentalis. The third swallow, still in the air, made a low pass at that second perched bird, which took off; I saw them in a close darting chase for ca 15 seconds. Both of these perches were within 15 m of 1 vertical dirt bank. At roughly 1000, I saw a single NRWS in low, darting flight ca 100 m above the diversion; saw it approach and briefly investigate (hovering in flight) a 2 m high vertical dirt bank near the reconstructed floodplain. Later, saw 3 NRWS in low, circling flight near the raised hill area. Then I saw 1 perch and call nearby for several minutes on a shrub within 5 m of a vertical earth bank at a bend in the stream, where NRWS activity seen last year as well. While that swallow remained perched, I saw another individual investigate at least 3 cavities in the bank, perching on a small rose bush and a Chokecherry root hanging from the bank, and at the entrance to at least 2 different cavities. Saw it actually enter 1 cavity, overhung by Leymus cinereus, and remain in it out of sight for over 30 seconds (video). Observed this sort of activity off and on for the next 5 minutes; saw 2 swallows (probably the same two?) perched amicably within less than 30 cm near a burrow entrance. As far as I could tell, the only activity at this earth bank so far was from 2 birds (1 pair). I definitely did see the same individual checking out different burrows consecutively, suggesting that it was investigating nest sites and not using one yet.",Stelgidopteryx serripennis,nrwswa,Species,23876,,4.50,2,,3290,4157

The square tail initially had me thinking Cliff Swallow, but the dull coloring and lack of overall contrast kept me wondering, especially as the Barn Swallows were muted but still distinctly colored/patterned despite the heavy cloud cover and poor light. This one appeared entirely browns.  To add context, Northern Rough-winged are in the area but the few that show up each year are typically on the west side of town or in a reservoir/park where there is a little more variety in the terrain. This park is 99% turf grass and a concrete-rimmed pond, a few small trees, and a small cattail filled storm runoff area. The High Line Canal borders the north edge of the park and has a little ""wild"" vegetation and a few trees. Surrounding apartments & houses are mostly lawn with a few trees.  The possibility of Northern Rough-winged came to mind initially but I wanted to double-check that it wasn't a low-flying swift or a Bank Swallow (or a dull Tree Swallow).  Tail was squarish, flight reminiscent of Tree or Barn Swallow, colors nearly Sepia above and khaki or sand-tan below. No outstanding contrasting whites or other colors. It came and left several times with the Barn Swallows for the roughly 15 or 20 minutes I was watching, making me wonder whether it has a nest or was simply taking breaks. I only ever observed the one, if two were present I am not aware of them. After reviewing pictures I did settle on Northern Rough-winged as the ID.",Stelgidopteryx serripennis,nrwswa,Species,23876,,4.00,2,,294,440
