This was south of the Point, opposite the pull-out halfway to South Gull Roost. Then I saw two were in the cypress together and one was playing with a twig; then the other (larger) one flew to pull-out and walked across it to where a guy in RV was feeding squirrels & gulls, and joined in. I telephone Rita to bring the camera. But the time she arrived the raven was hidden behind the RV, so we sneaked a peak and Rita noted two ravens together there. Both were surprisingly unskittish with the mass of gulls, etc., but they were dominate, several times chasing crows away. Got a long series of photos. This is the first pair ever at Pt.

At the nest, adults were seen coming in (sometimes both at the nest at same time) to feed their nestlings, which looks like their eyes are now open. The young appear quite alert now, begging aggressively when the adults visit the nest. They still only look like they're just beginning to get black body feathering. The young seem at that stage where they're so ugly they're kind of cute.   During one of the times both adults were down below the top of the dam an adult RTHA suddenly came into view flying fairly low over the top of the dam, heading slowly down-canyon. As soon as that hawk was seen, now fairly close to their nest, both of the adult ravens were immediately on the attack, and were quite aggressive and noisy in their effort. The hawk was quickly driven back towards the BDR side of the dam so were fairly quickly out of view from where I was watching down relatively close to the base of the dam. Their aggressiveness was impressive, being much more intense than the type of harassment CORAs might give a RTHA when, say, a hawk is circling way up overhead maybe a 1/4 to a 1/2 mile away from the ravens' nest.",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,4.50,4,Nest,1224,1669

These calls were twice the volume of any young crows I've ever heard. They were LOUD. Not too far up the hill I found four young ravens on low-lying logs. While they were quite large they were clearly young birds - I could tell by their total disregard for me, their nonstop begging, their preening, their still slightly red gapes and their overall curiosity for the surroundings. I waited 20 minutes hoping an adult would arrive and it did, calling the classic Raven croak the entire way. By the time it arrived the ""kids"" had moved higher up in the trees so I couldn't see the adult, but I did see its wedge-shaped tail as it flew out of the woods.

It's important that birders call the control room at (609) 390-5195 to let them know that you'll be watching for the ravens. The fishing pier area and the parking lot adjacent to the raven nesting spot are both fine for viewing, but I'd recommend staying out of the way of the workers coming and going.  This is apparently the first documented nest of Common Raven in Cape May County (though Witmer Stone's ""Bird Studies at Old Cape May"" suggests that ravens might have been resident in the county ~100 years ago, evidence of nesting here is absent). From the appearance of the current nest site, it seems possible that the ravens have used this nest in prior years.  Two adults are regularly bringing food to vocal young (unknown number) in the large stick nest which is tucked up underneath an overhanging part of the power plant facility (see enclosed photos for the exact spot), best viewed from near these coordinates in the parking lot: 39.289335, -74.633939.

Dio un giro y se detuvo en un pino cercano, donde después de unos minutos, entre que vocalizaba y se arreglaba el plumaje, voló a una roca y comenzó a comer de algo que estaba ahí, espantando a un Coragyps atratus que estaba cercano, probablemente una presa en descomposición. Mientras hacía eso, un segundo ejemplar apareció en la misma dirección, norte y se reunieron alejándose de la zona. En diciembre de 2023 vi dos ejemplares en Roble Negro, San Fernando, Morazán, pero no pude documentar la observación y por tanto el registro no ha sido aprobado como publico. (https://ebird.org/checklist/S155944968). Al igual que en Roble Negro, los residentes manifestaron que es ocasional verlos y escucharlos en la zona (Bailadero del Diablo, Llano del Muerto, Rancho Quemado, Sabanetas).

It was on the ground across the channel from the nest. The adult was close by, cawing insistently. Within a few minutes the young bird flew back across the channel and stayed under the bridge walking back and forth under the bridge for well over an hour. It mostly jumped from rock to rock, but occasionally it would fly a couple feet. Both parents were present, at one point watching from a steel girder perch under the bridge (see photo). The adults would sometimes fly out to the trees and caw. All of a sudden the fledgling flew about 50 feet back to the nest, which I caught on video. The parents cawed and flew around frantically. In the commotion I lost sight of the fledgling but found it a few minutes later on the opposite side of the bike path close to the edge of the highway, another 50 feet or so from the nest. The parents were continuing to caw frantically. I found the fledgling had moved to safer territory in the woods and both parents were watching from the trees above, close by. I then left after almost 90 minutes of observing the process. My only question is where is the first fledgling? Or is there a possibility this is the older bird and the younger one died? The timing based on reports from other eBirders suggests this is the second younger bird and the first bird also fledged successfully.",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,4.67,3,,3224,3839

We decided to check the nest site to see if any birds had fledged, as this was the first return trip since March when we noted an adult bird on the nest.  The visibility of the nest is impeded this year as the entire structure was moved to a position that made seeing anything sitting on the nest impossible without literally entering the structure and climbing up a ladder.  We did not see or hear any birds on the nest.  However, as I turned around, Ben was pointing at a bird directly behind us standing on some of the structure of an adjacent building.  The bird (photos) was obviously a recent fledgling.  The plumage appeared to be good with just a hint of the down feathers on its stomach area.  The bird was hopping and doing short flights, but appeared to not yet be ready for full flight.  We quickly exited the spot after taking photos.  We heard an adult call in the distance.  A few moments later as we drove away from the nest site we observed an adult bird in an agricultural field appear to grab some kind of food and fly down to an area that we presume the adults are using to keep the new fledglings safe and teach them to forage.  We will attempt to locate the family in the near future to determine the number of fledglings this year.",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,4.67,3,,3639,4549

We drove to NVF Plant in Yorklyn, and luckily saw this bird fly up and perch on the NVF Plant ruin across from the Yorklyn Post Office.  It perched and called for about 10 seconds.  I got photos, Jim got video.  A couple of the photos are below.  After the bird flew from this perch, it seemed to bank around the north side of the ruin and disappear.  We thought that it might have entered the building through one of the large open windows to perch inside.  A concentrated effort was made by us and several birders that came out quickly, but we could not relocate it.  Stakeout here tomorrow morning?",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,4.67,3,,2062,1813

This curious raven popped its head up and walked around the table and the adjacent tree, waiting for us to finish our sandwiches to snatch them up. Behind this sentimental raven which I named Cheeto, multiple geysers erupted in the rain. The raven expertly posed in front of the geysers creating a chaotic scene. I spent a long time with Cheeto, long enough to become decent friends. We wished each other the best until we meet again and he flew up, out and over the river before he vanished into the geyser smoke.

I waited 20 minutes hoping an adult would arrive and it did, calling the classic Raven croak the entire way. By the time it arrived the ""kids"" had moved higher up in the trees so I couldn't see the adult, but I did see its wedge-shaped tail as it flew out of the woods.

In this individual the bill (and the whole bird) was very large, the nasal bristles come only halfway down the length of the bill, and the tail was strongly wedge-shaped, all like Common Raven.    Common Raven is supposed to have ""pale silvery gray"" bases of the neck feathers rather than ""white"" in Chihuahuan. In photos (especially backlit ones like these), how the photos are exposed and processed can make a difference between ""white"" and ""pale silvery gray"".

Two days ago, I spotted two American Crows and two adult Bald Eagles feeding on these same carcasses and let my fellow birders know to be on the lookout for possible ravens, since they had been sighted along this stretch of road multiple times during the past two years, including once with newly-fledged young (by Jennifer Ferrick).  So, after I notified my fellow birders two days ago, Robert Scribner came immediately out to this carcass site and saw two ravens feeding, and even captured a few photos.  I came back yesterday afternoon and saw nothing.  This morning there were these two ravens feeding alongside this adult Bald Eagle.  A second Bald Eagle was perched nearby on the tree line.  It was quite instructional to watch the interaction between the eagle and the ravens on the carcass.  The ravens were quite bold and even mischievous toward the feeding eagle.  One raven repeated walked up behind the feeding eagle and bit its tail (one photo shows this).  The eagle would spin around, spread its wings, and lunge toward the ravens.  They would flutter out of reach, then walk right back and start feeding again.  I saw this 2-3 times.  The entire 15 minutes we watched, all three birds fed on the carcasses, with the ravens being the less dominate, and slightly smaller birds at the carrion piles.  Notice the large size of the ravens relative to the eagle, their massive bills, shaggy throats, and odd head profiles.  I never heard the ravens vocalize the entire time.",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,4.33,3,,1548,2250

We decided to check the nest site to see if any birds had fledged, as this was the first return trip since March when we noted an adult bird on the nest.  The visibility of the nest is impeded this year as the entire structure was moved to a position that made seeing anything sitting on the nest impossible without literally entering the structure and climbing up a ladder.  We did not see or hear any birds on the nest.  However, as I turned around, Ben was pointing at a bird directly behind us standing on some of the structure of an adjacent building.  The bird (photos) was obviously a recent fledgling.  The plumage appeared to be good with just a hint of the down feathers on its stomach area.  The bird was hopping and doing short flights, but appeared to not yet be ready for full flight.  We quickly exited the spot after taking photos.  We heard an adult call in the distance.  A few moments later as we drove away from the nest site we observed an adult bird in an agricultural field appear to grab some kind of food and fly down to an area that we presume the adults are using to keep the new fledglings safe and teach them to forage.  We will attempt to locate the family in the near future to determine the number of fledglings this year.",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,4.33,3,,3096,5504

Then we saw a single Raven fly to the neighbors roof, while carrying something in its beak. Then the Raven sat on the roof, and began picking apart a plucked carcass, looked like a chicken carcass. We were standing maybe 60 feet away watching the Raven through binoculars. The Raven was perfectly lit up by the sun. I suppose this could have been a carcass of some other kind of animal (like a skinned rabbit), rather than a chicken, but looking at it through binoculars with the sun lighting it up, it looked like a mostly eaten chicken carcass. A person in the neighborhood keeps chickens, but I don’t know if this is where the carcass I was looking at came from. And maybe this chicken was killed by a raptor, and then found by this Raven. It’s is impossible to know. After the first Raven ate the carcass for a while by plucking the meat off with its beak, there were some vocalizations between this Raven and a second Raven, a little ways away. Then the second Raven flew to the roof and landed right next to the first one. It looked like they were a friendly pair, because they were not aggressive towards each other.  After a moment the second Raven flew to the carcass and grabbed it away. Then after a moment the first Raven grabbed the carcass and the two birds tugged on the carcass until it split apart, and they each had a portion of the carcass and they both continued to pluck the remaining meat off the carcass as they sat on the roof.",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,5.00,2,,3024,4032

Over one hour yesterday, there appeared to be 13 feedings of nestlings, highest recorded thus far, but that is assuming that each trip into the barn was a feeding.   Earlier today and now in late afternoon now, no juvenile yells heard, and no nest material carried. Arriving we found that the property yard, usually extremely clean, had trash bags and boxes somehow overlooked and left out.  For the next hour the raven tore everything apart.  He (I think it was the male) nibbled as he worked, seeming to eat small pieces of this or that (he does the same thing when working down in dumpsters). He was cautious but obviously experienced in tearing into trash.   A chunk of whole pineapple gave him pause and he totally rejected it.  A Ritz cracker box attracted him, but he was little afraid of it, but ended up carrying it around.  At least 6 chunks of food were carried off and cached in the immediate area around the barn.  These chunks appeared to be either pieces of pizza or something similar.  Nothing from the immediate trash effort was fed to nestlings.",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,5.00,2,"",2454,5184

This dumpster is about 1225 feet from the nest in straight line flight.  I stayed 200-250 feet away to watch from my car.  The raven was down inside the dumpster when I arrived.  It brought out a round piece of deep-fried meat (photo), possibly Karaage (as best could be determined by finding a small piece later).  Over the next 10 minutes the raven had retrieved 3 more identical pieces, one at a time.  Each one was fed on briefly, then cached before retrieving the next one. Exception was the second one that was fed on for 2 minutes, then cached.   Raven left, starlings took over the dumpster.    Obviously the raven was being highly selective in its food choice this morning.",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,5.00,2,,2857,3361

Upon arrival, 2 ravens were sitting together in favorite tree.  One appeared to mount the second, but probably not successfully.  Then we realized there were 2 more ravens in the immediate area.   We assumed the 2 extra birds were the 2  fledglings from last year.  With binocs, we could see what looked like a yellowish gape.  The  pictures below show this and also show what appears to be a pale eye, all suggesting SY birds by appearance.  Behaviors of the adults and young suggest the same.  Twice an adult flew in with food, and we think the food was just put down and the youngsters ate it on their own. Once they  wing-quivered as the adult landed.  Many odd vocalizations between these birds, one of which was a lower, quieter croak with a strangled sound to it.  We saw no bird fly to the nest this morning.   On 11/16/18 we saw 3 ravens together at the Massey Building area, and similarly on 12/12/18, over Ashby Pond, and we wondered if it was the Willcox pair with one of their young from last year, but this is the first time we had any birds other than adults in the nest area since last summer.  We find it interesting that in this harsh weather just ending that the adults might supply food to the SY birds.",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,5.00,2,,2589,3458

The photo with the birds head in profile on your website clearly shows that the bristles are not long enough and the bill shape is Common Raven. The angle of your first photograph makes it difficult to judge bristle length and bill shape. Also the base of the feathers on the throat are pale gray rather than white (compare with the white droppings next to the bird).  ... The habitat (high up Mt Lemmon) also makes it far more likely to get a Common Raven. I also found other pictures of Common Raven, taken well outside Chihuahan Raven range, on MacAulay library that display similarly grey neck feathers.",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,4.00,3,,1100,1650

Mientras hacía eso, un segundo ejemplar apareció en la misma dirección, norte y se reunieron alejándose de la zona. En diciembre de 2023 vi dos ejemplares en Roble Negro, San Fernando, Morazán, pero no pude documentar la observación y por tanto el registro no ha sido aprobado como publico.

Two days ago, I spotted two American Crows and two adult Bald Eagles feeding on these same carcasses and let my fellow birders know to be on the lookout for possible ravens, since they had been sighted along this stretch of road multiple times during the past two years, including once with newly-fledged young (by Jennifer Ferrick).  So, after I notified my fellow birders two days ago, Robert Scribner came immediately out to this carcass site and saw two ravens feeding, and even captured a few photos.  I came back yesterday afternoon and saw nothing.  This morning there were these two ravens feeding alongside this adult Bald Eagle.  A second Bald Eagle was perched nearby on the tree line.  It was quite instructional to watch the interaction between the eagle and the ravens on the carcass.  The ravens were quite bold and even mischievous toward the feeding eagle.  One raven repeated walked up behind the feeding eagle and bit its tail (one photo shows this).  The eagle would spin around, spread its wings, and lunge toward the ravens.  They would flutter out of reach, then walk right back and start feeding again.  I saw this 2-3 times.  The entire 15 minutes we watched, all three birds fed on the carcasses, with the ravens being the less dominate, and slightly smaller birds at the carrion piles.  Notice the large size of the ravens relative to the eagle, their massive bills, shaggy throats, and odd head profiles.  I never heard the ravens vocalize the entire time.",Corvus corax,comrav,Species,21400,,4.00,3,Multiple species,1620,2250

Found a big group (10) harassing eagles, then flying together towards the north.  Photos.  They called almost continuously while interacting, mostly with the ""pop"" type calls.  The first interaction I saw seemed like a pair perhaps in courtship, as nesting will certainly begin soon.  The other interactions seemed more like play, as the birds wheeled and chased each other, sometimes flipping upside down while pursuing each other.  After the group finished harassing the eagles, they worked as a group towards the north and slowly went different directions, sometimes in pairs, and a couple of larger groups.  I think that there were more than 12 there, but I went with the number I was certain of seeing.  Several birds were heard more distantly, but not seen.
