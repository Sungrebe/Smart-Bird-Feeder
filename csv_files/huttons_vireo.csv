After 3 1/2 hours of birding in smoke from a 9000 acre forest fire, we found the bird in the grove of trees between the upper parking lot and HQ above the sidewalk.  The bird is as described by Nick Mrvelij and Peyton Cook with help from Russ Namitz on 9/2/19, the same day we saw the bird the first time. A thick bill eliminated a ruby-crowned kinglet.  Pale lores, incomplete pale eye ring separated this bird from Cassin's.  We also looked at many photos in ebird of both species and believe this is a Hutton's vireo.

Additionally, the legs were rather stout and all bluish, including the toes - not black with yellowish toes as is typical with kinglets. The Hutton’s Vireo was first heard doing the typical harsh ""whine"" call (as named by Pieplow), which is a rising and abrupt alarm call, typically in slow series. I was able to locate the vireo on the east side of the park, in the trees near the bridge by the El Rio parking lot. A compact and large-headed vireo with overall greenish upperparts, and olive cast below. Pale crescents surrounded the eyes in front, below and behind, creating an eye-ringed look. The lores were completely pale, differentiating it from Plumbeous or Cassin's vireos. Two pale wing bars on gray-green wings with greenish flight feather edges; no black base of the secondaries, so no dark wing panel as in kinglets.

After 3 1/2 hours of birding in smoke from a 9000 acre forest fire, we found the bird in the grove of trees between the upper parking lot and HQ above the sidewalk.  The bird is as described by Nick Mrvelij and Peyton Cook with help from Russ Namitz on 9/2/19, the same day we saw the bird the first time. A thick bill eliminated a ruby-crowned kinglet.  Pale lores, incomplete pale eye ring separated this bird from Cassin's.  We also looked at many photos in ebird of both species and believe this is a Hutton's vireo.

The photo below does not provide a look at the broken eye-ring, which is similar for both species.  However, this shot does show certain markers distinctive to the Hutton’s.  They are the hooked upper mandible of the vireo, bluish gray legs & feet, and the fact the greenish edges go right up to the bottom of the secondaries.

However, I was struck by how sluggish the bird seemed and immediately suspected Hutton's Vireo and began to study the bird closely. There is no doubt at all it was a Hutton's Vireo. The lores were obviously pale. There was a prominent white eye ring. There were two bold white wing bars. The bill was large and hooked and solid gray, absolutely not a kinglet. I would have called the legs, including the feet, gray. Field guides calls them bluish. But they weren't black and the feet weren't yellow, like a kinglet. I used a little playback just to try to confirm what I was seeing and because the bird had moved out of view. The bird was extremely responsive, coming in two separate times to five seconds of playback. He never vocalized himself, or I would have tried getting a recording. Unfortunately, I left the camera at home this morning! I did get some epically terrible shots with my phone. (The bird is mostly unidentifiable, but a couple of the pics do perhaps show the pale lores.)",Vireo huttoni,hutvir2,Group,19015,,3.50,2,,1600,2400

Marantz on 23 November 2017 at the University of California campus, Riverside, Riverside County, California.","I spotted this bird foraging quietly in the lower branches of a sycamore just west of the Campus Health Center, where it remained for a few minutes before moving off.  This was a small bird with a plump body and a bill that was somewhat stouter than that of a kinglet and having a blunt tip.  I thought this bird was proportionately larger-headed than a kinglet and its eyeing was incomplete being broken above the eye and expanded behind it, two simple wingbars with a darker band between the two, but not a second band across the bases of the remiges.  The head and upperparts were olive and the underparts were a dingy olive-buff and unmarked, which combined to make this bird look much like a kinglet.

The thicker bill and wing bars are the differences that he pointed out. The leg coloring was obscured due to being behind tree branches. Upon recalling the moment, this bird was not as twitchy as a kinglet. I have changed the species on my list and pictures with the correct identification. The vireo was spotted on the east side of Anthem Community Park   off of the sidewall between the baseball field and natural wash facing the Anthem Community Center.  I am glad the pictures show enough details of this species which I have not encountered before.

This was not an easy bird in the field. Nick kept leaning towards Hutton’s so Kudos to him. Here are Nick Mrvelj’s comments: When I first saw this bird in the field, I called it a HUVI. We watched it for several minutes, taking many pictures. Due to the rarity factor, I talked myself into this being a juvenile CAVI, against my better judgement. However, even a juvenile CAVI would show a dark break in the lores, interrupting the spectacled look. This individual has pale lores, lacking this aforementioned feature. Also, the eyering is narrow near the bottom of the eye, and not continuously bold as on even a 1st fall CAVI. I’ve looked at several images of 1st fall CAVI and HUVI since this sighting, and feel this bird is a solid HUVI.",Vireo huttoni,hutvir,Species,19005,,3.00,3,,2370,3160

This was not an easy bird in the field. Nick kept leaning towards Hutton’s so Kudos to him. Here are Nick Mrvelj’s comments: When I first saw this bird in the field, I called it a HUVI. We watched it for several minutes, taking many pictures. Due to the rarity factor, I talked myself into this being a juvenile CAVI, against my better judgement. However, even a juvenile CAVI would show a dark break in the lores, interrupting the spectacled look. This individual has pale lores, lacking this aforementioned feature. Also, the eyering is narrow near the bottom of the eye, and not continuously bold as on even a 1st fall CAVI. I’ve looked at several images of 1st fall CAVI and HUVI since this sighting, and feel this bird is a solid HUVI.",Vireo huttoni,hutvir,Species,19005,,3.00,4,,2336,3115

Not a bird I was ever expecting at PVER. Probably the first record for Blythe/the Colorado River part of Riverside? I presume that all LCRV records pertain to the mexican ssp though I don't really know. First seen here (33.6988281, -114.5008937) around 9:30. I heard a weird vireo call and went to investigate then got distracted by a Gray Fly coming into mob. As about 5 kinglets were coming in I looked at one and saw it had bluish legs and took a double-take. It turned to face me and sure enough it had a large, hooked vireo bill and boldish spectacles like a Hutton's (not as bold as cassins thought), and otherwise matched RCKI in plumage just about exactly other than lacking the ""kinglet bar"" on the wing. Structurally it was different from kinglets, being larger, chunkier and just overall more plump along with having notably thicker legs (plus of course not hovergleaning). It had a weird gummed up face making it a very recognizable individual. I was shocked to REfind this bird nearly a mile away here (33.7098190, -114.4986484) 5 hours later at 2:30 pm. Photod.",Vireo huttoni,hutvir,Species,19005,,3.00,2,,1392,1667

However, I was struck by how sluggish the bird seemed and immediately suspected Hutton's Vireo and began to study the bird closely. There is no doubt at all it was a Hutton's Vireo. The lores were obviously pale. There was a prominent white eye ring. There were two bold white wing bars. The bill was large and hooked and solid gray, absolutely not a kinglet. I would have called the legs, including the feet, gray. Field guides calls them bluish. But they weren't black and the feet weren't yellow, like a kinglet. I used a little playback just to try to confirm what I was seeing and because the bird had moved out of view. The bird was extremely responsive, coming in two separate times to five seconds of playback. He never vocalized himself, or I would have tried getting a recording. Unfortunately, I left the camera at home this morning! I did get some epically terrible shots with my phone. (The bird is mostly unidentifiable, but a couple of the pics do perhaps show the pale lores.)",Vireo huttoni,hutvir2,Group,19015,,3.00,2,,1600,2400

I heard a weird vireo call and went to investigate then got distracted by a Gray Fly coming into mob. As about 5 kinglets were coming in I looked at one and saw it had bluish legs and took a double-take. It turned to face me and sure enough it had a large, hooked vireo bill and boldish spectacles like a Hutton's (not as bold as cassins thought), and otherwise matched RCKI in plumage just about exactly other than lacking the ""kinglet bar"" on the wing. Structurally it was different from kinglets, being larger, chunkier and just overall more plump along with having notably thicker legs (plus of course not hovergleaning). It had a weird gummed up face making it a very recognizable individual. I was shocked to REfind this bird nearly a mile away here (33.7098190, -114.4986484) 5 hours later at 2:30 pm. Photod.",Vireo huttoni,hutvir,Species,19005,,3.00,1,,2120,3253

A stocky, large-headed vireo with a bold white eyering, thickest behind the eye, and broken above. Superficially similar to a Ruby-crowned Kinglet, but note the thick bluish bill with the hooked tip, and the lack of black coloration at the base of the folded secondaries. Additionally, note the sturdy, bluish legs.
