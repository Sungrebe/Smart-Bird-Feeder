If other Flickers are present, it is chased off, especially by two intergrade males. He also visits early when the light is poor, so hard to catch good photos for field marker discernments. At first I was unsure if pure yellow-shafted. Today I was able to capture better photos and based on thick, bold chevron, thick black malars void of any red, beige-pink throat, neck, and cheeks, brown brow, and highlighter yellow-shafts on wings and tail, I believe I have a true yellow-shafted Flicker now intermittently joining the 10 individuals that have been visiting since early November.

If other Flickers are present, it is chased off, especially by two intergrade males. He also visits early when the light is poor, so hard to catch good photos for field marker discernments. At first I was unsure if pure yellow-shafted. Today I was able to capture better photos and based on thick, bold chevron, thick black malars void of any red, beige-pink throat, neck, and cheeks, brown brow, and highlighter yellow-shafts on wings and tail, I believe I have a true yellow-shafted Flicker now intermittently joining the 10 individuals that have been visiting since early November.

This was quite a challenge since I only had a 20-minute window every day before school started. My very first impressions of it were that it has the characteristic gold shafts that stood out against the wings and tails of the normal red-shafted flickers it likes to hang out with. After seeing those wings first, it took me a while to get a clear view of the head, which did end up having a tan face and gray nape, with no mustache marks. Today it decided to go off its normal course and fly into a patch of trees that are very easy to walk around, and I finally got decent photos, which will be added shortly.",Colaptes auratus,yesfli,Group,11788,,5.00,2,,4080,3072
