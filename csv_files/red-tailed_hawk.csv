It's beginning to molt and has lost the two innermost primaries, so hopefully if it hangs around another few weeks we'll see what those new adult flight feathers look like. This bird could be an intergrade with calurus, but it has very broad barring on the secondaries, and the tail, and the tip of the tail has at least a partial 'spike' at the tips shown by most juv dark harlani. The bases of the tail feathers and some primaries have vague mottling already.

Absolutely gorgeous and fearless Red-Tailed Hawk. I saw it sitting in the trees and pulled over to try and take a few pictures when it flew down to eye level and perched in a leafless shrub. There it sat looking around seemingly perch hunting. I was very close to it already so I walked a bit closer. The hawk watched me intently and with curiosity as I approached but remained very calm the whole time. Eventually, I got within FIVE FEET of the hawk. If I had leaned forward I would have been able to pet its head. It was surreal seeing a completely wild hawk so close. As I got within that limit, the hawk started flinching so I stopped approaching and backed up a tiny bit so I didn't stress him. Then after staring at me for a while he went back to his business, looking around and also preening. I sat there for nearly a half hour with a wild Red-Tailed Hawk just feet ahead of me at nearly eye level. It was absolutely gorgeous. Finally, after nearly a half hour of sitting beside him, the hawk leaped off the branch and flew to a lamp post. I left him after that. Wow that was an insane encounter!!!  He (or she) was a young bird currently molting into adult plumage. Part of its fearlessness may have been due to its young age.",Buteo jamaicensis,erthaw1,Group,8416,,4.70,30,,,

Absolutely gorgeous and fearless Red-Tailed Hawk. I saw it sitting in the trees and pulled over to try and take a few pictures when it flew down to eye level and perched in a leafless shrub. There it sat looking around seemingly perch hunting. I was very close to it already so I walked a bit closer. The hawk watched me intently and with curiosity as I approached but remained very calm the whole time. Eventually, I got within FIVE FEET of the hawk. If I had leaned forward I would have been able to pet its head. It was surreal seeing a completely wild hawk so close. As I got within that limit, the hawk started flinching so I stopped approaching and backed up a tiny bit so I didn't stress him. Then after staring at me for a while he went back to his business, looking around and also preening. I sat there for nearly a half hour with a wild Red-Tailed Hawk just feet ahead of me at nearly eye level. It was absolutely gorgeous. Finally, after nearly a half hour of sitting beside him, the hawk leaped off the branch and flew to a lamp post. I left him after that. Wow that was an insane encounter!!!  He (or she) was a young bird currently molting into adult plumage. Part of its fearlessness may have been due to its young age.",Buteo jamaicensis,erthaw1,Group,8416,,4.67,9,,,

I assumed the Red-tail had given up, but swooped down from  the tree, talons fully extended, and rammed strait into the nest like a wrecking ball. Scooped out 1 baby bird, and quickly flew off and landed on a nearby branch to dine. Many more birds joined the assault, until the Red-tail flew off into the deeper woods.

Absolutely gorgeous and fearless Red-Tailed Hawk. I saw it sitting in the trees and pulled over to try and take a few pictures when it flew down to eye level and perched in a leafless shrub. There it sat looking around seemingly perch hunting. I was very close to it already so I walked a bit closer. The hawk watched me intently and with curiosity as I approached but remained very calm the whole time. Eventually, I got within FIVE FEET of the hawk. If I had leaned forward I would have been able to pet its head. It was surreal seeing a completely wild hawk so close. As I got within that limit, the hawk started flinching so I stopped approaching and backed up a tiny bit so I didn't stress him. Then after staring at me for a while he went back to his business, looking around and also preening. I sat there for nearly a half hour with a wild Red-Tailed Hawk just feet ahead of me at nearly eye level. It was absolutely gorgeous. Finally, after nearly a half hour of sitting beside him, the hawk leaped off the branch and flew to a lamp post. I left him after that. Wow that was an insane encounter!!!  He (or she) was a young bird currently molting into adult plumage. Part of its fearlessness may have been due to its young age.",Buteo jamaicensis,erthaw1,Group,8416,,4.31,13,,,

Absolutely gorgeous and fearless Red-Tailed Hawk. I saw it sitting in the trees and pulled over to try and take a few pictures when it flew down to eye level and perched in a leafless shrub. There it sat looking around seemingly perch hunting. I was very close to it already so I walked a bit closer. The hawk watched me intently and with curiosity as I approached but remained very calm the whole time. Eventually, I got within FIVE FEET of the hawk. If I had leaned forward I would have been able to pet its head. It was surreal seeing a completely wild hawk so close. As I got within that limit, the hawk started flinching so I stopped approaching and backed up a tiny bit so I didn't stress him. Then after staring at me for a while he went back to his business, looking around and also preening. I sat there for nearly a half hour with a wild Red-Tailed Hawk just feet ahead of me at nearly eye level. It was absolutely gorgeous. Finally, after nearly a half hour of sitting beside him, the hawk leaped off the branch and flew to a lamp post. I left him after that. Wow that was an insane encounter!!!  He (or she) was a young bird currently molting into adult plumage. Part of its fearlessness may have been due to its young age.",Buteo jamaicensis,erthaw1,Group,8416,,4.57,7,,,

Absolutely gorgeous and fearless Red-Tailed Hawk. I saw it sitting in the trees and pulled over to try and take a few pictures when it flew down to eye level and perched in a leafless shrub. There it sat looking around seemingly perch hunting. I was very close to it already so I walked a bit closer. The hawk watched me intently and with curiosity as I approached but remained very calm the whole time. Eventually, I got within FIVE FEET of the hawk. If I had leaned forward I would have been able to pet its head. It was surreal seeing a completely wild hawk so close. As I got within that limit, the hawk started flinching so I stopped approaching and backed up a tiny bit so I didn't stress him. Then after staring at me for a while he went back to his business, looking around and also preening. I sat there for nearly a half hour with a wild Red-Tailed Hawk just feet ahead of me at nearly eye level. It was absolutely gorgeous. Finally, after nearly a half hour of sitting beside him, the hawk leaped off the branch and flew to a lamp post. I left him after that. Wow that was an insane encounter!!!  He (or she) was a young bird currently molting into adult plumage. Part of its fearlessness may have been due to its young age.",Buteo jamaicensis,erthaw1,Group,8416,,4.50,6,,,

The photo confirms a dark redtail, with a dark chin, coarse, dark reddish streaking on what would be unmarked white underparts on a standard eastern bird, and much darker, more chocolate-color tones in the belly band, patagials, upperparts, etc. The belly band is also splattery, and widens at the edges where they meet the axillaries.

As suspected, this bird appears to be an intergrade between Harlan's and probably calurus. Harlan's characters here are mostly visible in the flight feathers, which are heavily banded with a thick, irregular pattern, and the bases of the primaries are mottled gray. The tail is mostly red, with some banding restricted to the base--the latter character seen in many Red-tailed Hawk subspecies breeding in the far north, but also rarely occurs in calurus. As I suspected in my notes on this individual from 23 March 2018, much of the habitat here is now gone, converted to strawberry fields. We'll see if this bird can make a living here this winter.

Absolutely gorgeous and fearless Red-Tailed Hawk. I saw it sitting in the trees and pulled over to try and take a few pictures when it flew down to eye level and perched in a leafless shrub. There it sat looking around seemingly perch hunting. I was very close to it already so I walked a bit closer. The hawk watched me intently and with curiosity as I approached but remained very calm the whole time. Eventually, I got within FIVE FEET of the hawk. If I had leaned forward I would have been able to pet its head. It was surreal seeing a completely wild hawk so close. As I got within that limit, the hawk started flinching so I stopped approaching and backed up a tiny bit so I didn't stress him. Then after staring at me for a while he went back to his business, looking around and also preening. I sat there for nearly a half hour with a wild Red-Tailed Hawk just feet ahead of me at nearly eye level. It was absolutely gorgeous. Finally, after nearly a half hour of sitting beside him, the hawk leaped off the branch and flew to a lamp post. I left him after that. Wow that was an insane encounter!!!  He (or she) was a young bird currently molting into adult plumage. Part of its fearlessness may have been due to its young age.",Buteo jamaicensis,erthaw1,Group,8416,,4.60,5,,,

This bird clearly has a pale face, but beyond that it's tough to say much about it. To ID kriderii and harlani you need good photos of the spread wings and tail, showing both the upper sides and the under sides. This bird could be a very pale-faced borealis, or a borealis x kriderii, or something cooler. Unfortunately we can't do much with just these two perched shots. I'm always happy to see any and all photos that you find interesting or challenging. You can never see too many Red-tailed Hawks!",Buteo jamaicensis,rethaw,Species,8410,,4.00,5,,1193,1193

Eventually it came to ground, looking as though it had captured something, repeatedly looking at its feet buried in long dried grasses. When it flew up to a tangle of vines nearby, it has nothing. It perched on the pile for a little while, right in front of me, before flying up to sit on a different branch. A Blue Jay acted only slightly offended by its presence, but the hawk behaved as if there was no Blue Jay at all. Eventually it flew up the road to land in a tree too distant to photograph it in.

Captured and banded as part of the Red-tailed Hawk Project - www.redtailedhawkproject.org. Band #1857-02188 and color band Blue 6Y. This bird also now carries a GSM transmitter, and I will update its breeding location and migratory route on the website when these data are available. This bird is also an exciting recapture. It was first banded by Sylvain Bourdages in Grand Prairie, Alberta in May 2015. At the time, it was in juvenal plumage and just starting its second pre basic molt. Because of this, we know the individual is an eighth cycle. More details on this band recovery, including photos of the bird as a juvenile, can be found at https://redtailedhawkproject.org/2022/04/01/a-band-recovery-connecting-eastern-kansas-to-grand-prairie-alberta/",,Buteo jamaicensis,rethaw,Species,8410,,4.25,4,In-hand,2658,3987

This bird clearly has a pale face, but beyond that it's tough to say much about it. To ID kriderii and harlani you need good photos of the spread wings and tail, showing both the upper sides and the under sides. This bird could be a very pale-faced borealis, or a borealis x kriderii, or something cooler. Unfortunately we can't do much with just these two perched shots.

Close inspection of details of the secondaries, primaries, and tail, reveal enough characters to support the ID has Harlan's, though an intergrade with Western cannot be ruled out entirely. Note especially the pattern of the secondary tips, which are dark with white blotches on the inner webs. The banding in the primaries is somewhat wavy, especially on the upperside, and there is a suggestion of mottling at the bases of the outer 6 primaries. The banding in the flight feathers and tail is thicker than what would be expected on Western, and better for Harlan's. Tail pattern in unusual in having thick bands that fade out near the base; uppertail coverts all-dark--also unusual. Solid dark juveniles like this are rare in Western, and more common in Harlan's, though Harlan's usually has a blacker ground color--not always. This bird is at the dark extreme for a juvenile Red-tailed Hawk of any subspecies, lacking any obvious pattern. It really requires close study to see the details needed to confirm the ID as Harlan's, and luckily this bird is obliging when it is in view. This bird's behavior is unusual in two ways: it is very tame, unlike most Harlan's; and it is quite sneaky, staying low, perch-hunting from edge and some exposed perches, but not getting up to soar much.",Buteo jamaicensis,hrthaw1,Group,8411,,4.33,3,,2086,3335

Absolutely gorgeous and fearless Red-Tailed Hawk. I saw it sitting in the trees and pulled over to try and take a few pictures when it flew down to eye level and perched in a leafless shrub. There it sat looking around seemingly perch hunting. I was very close to it already so I walked a bit closer. The hawk watched me intently and with curiosity as I approached but remained very calm the whole time. Eventually, I got within FIVE FEET of the hawk. If I had leaned forward I would have been able to pet its head. It was surreal seeing a completely wild hawk so close. As I got within that limit, the hawk started flinching so I stopped approaching and backed up a tiny bit so I didn't stress him. Then after staring at me for a while he went back to his business, looking around and also preening. I sat there for nearly a half hour with a wild Red-Tailed Hawk just feet ahead of me at nearly eye level. It was absolutely gorgeous. Finally, after nearly a half hour of sitting beside him, the hawk leaped off the branch and flew to a lamp post. I left him after that. Wow that was an insane encounter!!!  He (or she) was a young bird currently molting into adult plumage. Part of its fearlessness may have been due to its young age.",Buteo jamaicensis,erthaw1,Group,8416,,4.33,3,,,
