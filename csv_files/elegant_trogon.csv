Discovered by Jane Azzaro.  I was hiking up the Panther Trail for a second sweep for the Trogon at about 5pm, when I paused to talk shop with Justin Bosler who was making his way downstream.  While we were standing there, I was facing west and saw a large grayish bird fly across the trail at about eye level, some 50yds upstream, and seemingly land near the south edge of the trail.  The added flash of pink-red seen in flight made me immediately think I was on the Trogon.  I quickly called out to Justin, and we made our way up the trail to close the gap, and found the Trogon on a low perch.  The bird then flew back to the creek area and began to flycatch.  Eventually, many birders converged on the site and had excellent extended views as the bird slowly made its way downstream.  Last seen flying to the north slope of the creek.  Classic large Trogon shaped bird, with an overall gray-greenish brown stocky/plump body, large round-blockish head, grayish face, dark lores, big striking dark eyes with pale/reddish eye ring, white wedge behind eye, bulky short yellow bill, long rich brown squared off tail with unique fine black and white barred edging.

I watched it hover-glean insects in the elms and live oaks briefly and then spend 25 minutes foraging in the leafless mesquites. It would sit, looking around, studying the nearby bare branches, and then make a short flight, hovering to glean something small and dark (pink-purplish) from the branches, usually near the nodes. It even landed on a low rock wall just above ground level. Slowly, it then worked its way up the canyon—toward Cave Creek Ranch.

Discovered by Jane Azzaro.  I was hiking up the Panther Trail for a second sweep for the Trogon at about 5pm, when I paused to talk shop with Justin Bosler who was making his way downstream.  While we were standing there, I was facing west and saw a large grayish bird fly across the trail at about eye level, some 50yds upstream, and seemingly land near the south edge of the trail.  The added flash of pink-red seen in flight made me immediately think I was on the Trogon.  I quickly called out to Justin, and we made our way up the trail to close the gap, and found the Trogon on a low perch.  The bird then flew back to the creek area and began to flycatch.  Eventually, many birders converged on the site and had excellent extended views as the bird slowly made its way downstream.  Last seen flying to the north slope of the creek.  Classic large Trogon shaped bird, with an overall gray-greenish brown stocky/plump body, large round-blockish head, grayish face, dark lores, big striking dark eyes with pale/reddish eye ring, white wedge behind eye, bulky short yellow bill, long rich brown squared off tail with unique fine black and white barred edging.

These instructions are if you are coming up the trail from Landa Park. The bird was located near the bench that is off the trail about 20 yards on the west side (left side) of the trail about half way up the trail. There are a few benches that you will pass within 100 to 200 yards of the road that are right by the trail go past these. About 12:15 I was coming back down the trail headed to the park for a break, when I got near the bench I noticed a few birders coming up the trail, taking my eye off the trees briefly. The bird flushed over my head and landed about 10 yards from us. The bird was quite active and a number of us heard it vocalize a couple of times as it moved from one tree to the other. Great looks at the bird as it moved down the trail for at least 45 minutes. About 10 to 12 birders during this time.",Trogon elegans,eletro,Species,9465,,5.00,1,,1208,1151

It sat there, preening, even as a Cooper’s Hawk flew right under it on a hunting trip down the creek.

Discovered by Jane Azzaro.  I was hiking up the Panther Trail for a second sweep for the Trogon at about 5pm, when I paused to talk shop with Justin Bosler who was making his way downstream.  While we were standing there, I was facing west and saw a large grayish bird fly across the trail at about eye level, some 50yds upstream, and seemingly land near the south edge of the trail.  The added flash of pink-red seen in flight made me immediately think I was on the Trogon.  I quickly called out to Justin, and we made our way up the trail to close the gap, and found the Trogon on a low perch.  The bird then flew back to the creek area and began to flycatch.  Eventually, many birders converged on the site and had excellent extended views as the bird slowly made its way downstream.  Last seen flying to the north slope of the creek.  Classic large Trogon shaped bird, with an overall gray-greenish brown stocky/plump body, large round-blockish head, grayish face, dark lores, big striking dark eyes with pale/reddish eye ring, white wedge behind eye, bulky short yellow bill, long rich brown squared off tail with unique fine black and white barred edging.  Dingy pale below, grayish green breast, and distinct pink-red undertail coverts.   Fantastic looks with 8x42s and photographed.",Trogon elegans,eletro,Species,9465,,3.00,1,,2750,3438

As I got closer I noticed that it was squatter then a dove and had a thick yellow bill. I also noticed the white teardrop coming down from its eye. It had a darker, gray-green hood and lighter breast. It sat on the feeder pole for a minute or two while I took pictures. When I started to back away it flew across the street into the neighbors olive tree. I was able to see some red feathering in the center of the tail as it flew away. I think it was female due to the white teardrop and the relatively uniform back color. I'm not sure if it was a coppery-tailed or elegant.",Trogon elegans,eletro,Species,9465,,2.00,1,,3000,4000

The bird flew across the trail from the west to east about 100 feet past the entering national forest sign right where the trail makes the first switchback across the creek. He sat on a lower branch of a sycamore tree and then dropped down onto a three foot tree stump on the ground. He then briefly flew up and caught a large insect and went back into the lower part of the sycamore tree and ate it. I spent about five minutes with the bird before he flew north up the creek. I will attach photos of the trogon eating the insect and perched on the short tree stump.,Trogon elegans,eletro,Species,9465,,2.00,1,,3621,2897

Several folks helped us get on the bird, which was actively moving from tree to tree and primarily along the main creek wash.   The bird appeared to be a female with prominent white mark behind the eye, red orbital ring, and yellow bill. Grayish head and chest, which terminated abruptly, forming a white collar. Rosy belly and vent, grayish/green back, coppery central tail feathers, and unique barred undertail pattern.   It made its way up a steep wash on the side of the hill and wasn't seen again for over an hour, appearing around 5:23pm near the exact spot it was reported on Sunday evening.

Heard first, giving a short sputtering call reminiscent of the Gray Tree Frog of the eastern US. Initial thought was that it might be a squirrel, but  subsequent iterations of the call were identical, and silence between them seemed to indicate not a squirrel. Then y-b cuckoo crossed my mind, since I'd seen one here a few days earlier, but zero response to playback of just the intro notes - kuk-kuk-kuk - of the typical cuckoo outburst had me baffled, until I dared consider a trogon. The bird still vocalizing after two minutes of these ruminations, I decided to risk a close approach to the large ornamental pear tree where the calls were coming from, peered up into it, and was delighted to see a female Elegant Trogon in unobscured, frontal view about ten feet up in the bare branches of the interior of the tree. We traded stares for about 5 seconds, upon which she bolted toward Miller Creek (dry) and I lost sight of her around the corner of the house. Camera in hand, I spotted her at the creekbed, perching between fluttering sallies, and managed one poor but diagnostic photo. As I angled for a better one showing the bird's head, which was annoyingly obscured by a branch, she slipped away and I did not see her again.",Trogon elegans,eletro,Species,9465,,1.00,1,,1122,898

La parte superior del pecho con la coloración oscura y posteriormente una línea blanca sucia, seguida de un color café grisáceo y después rojo mezclado con blanco en la parte inferior.

Also it was making the ""fast chuckle"" call occasionally, an alarm call, which Pieplow's guide says is infrequent. Audio and very poor photo attached. At first I thought it was a female based on the red only being on the belly (I would have expected males to stay on territory this late into the winter). But after talking to Theresa Lawson who saw an ELTR male with partial red belly in Ramsey the next day, and reading Birds of the World plumage account, mine is likely a first-winter male also. BoW says the male has a breast like a female, may or may not be mixed with red. But I didn’t see the back so I re-examined my horrible photos and a couple show light gray by the upper wing, that would make it a male. So changing this to likely first-year male.",Trogon elegans,eletro,Species,9465,,1.00,3,,2306,1730
