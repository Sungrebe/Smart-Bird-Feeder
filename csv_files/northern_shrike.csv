I originally spotted the bird at about 41.4477324, -73.8677037. It was on a small tree about 8 feet tall just behind, a couple piles of wood chips, covered in tarp. When I stepped out of my car, I scared it into the shrubs, lower down, making it very difficult to see and then I lost it entirely. Good luck to anyone who tries to find it!

Both Sam Hough and I were able to get photos of the bird.  After reviewing the photos at home and consulting a number of books, I am convinced this is an immature Northern Shrike rather than an immature Loggerhead Shrike.  Characteristics that support this conclusion are:  * At this time of the year, an immature Loggerhead Shrike should have fairly close to adult plumage; this bird has retained some of its juvenile characteristics, and the plumage is quite different than that of an adult.  * Brown head with narrow mask that does not extend above the middle of the eyes; mask thinner in front of the eyes; white eye ring fairly easily seen.  * Bill not as long as what you would see in an adult; extensive pale area at base of lower mandible.  * Back has no barring and has a light brown tint.  * Very obvious light brown tint scaling on breast, belly and flanks (not barring like a juvenile Loggerhead Shrike).",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,4.00,4,,1747,2275

Showed up in middle of previously reported open area around 0958 after not being detected during my first walk around the perimeter of the area, then stayed in view for approximately the next hour before disappearing again. Initially seen perched on top of a tree here (39.9025164, -122.0727698), then flew to a couple trees nearby during my visit.   Large shrike - seemed larger than LOSH, though hard to judge without side-by-side comparison; substantial dark bill with pronounced hook to upper mandible, paler towards base; white over top of base of bill; weaker black mask than LOSH - more prominent behind the eye (a little bit wider than one eye width and about as long as two eye widths) than in front of it, and with white completely surrounding the eye, almost like spectacles; black eye; gray from crown to rump; rump whitish; upper tail black; whitish/very pale underparts with warm wash and fine barring from breast to belly that appeared maroon or brownish in my scope; black wings with small white wing patch and white tips to (secondaries/tertials?) and very thin pale tips to primaries; whitish utcs; black legs; underside of tail appeared mostly white due to white (tail spots?), though I never saw the tail spread well. [Notes taken before looking at my photos or field guide.]  After spending some time perched at the top of a tree, the shrike laddered down through the branches and then dove down into some nearby low bushes. It quickly maneuvered through them before flying back up to the tree holding what appeared to be a very downy and gray bird chick in its bill. After impaling the presumed chick on one of the branches, it proceeded to rip it up and eat the whole thing. Shortly after this, it started vocalizing spontaneously for the first time during my observation. I believe I heard and recorded at least three different types of vocalizations, which was extremely cool. It then spent the remainder of my observation generally preening, cleaning its bill against branches and surveying its realm before making a short flight and then disappearing.  All in all, I'm not sure if I've had a more prolonged and satisfying experience with a single bird in California since I started birding. Stoked the gamble of driving all the way up here for this bird paid off.  Photos. Audio. Video.",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,4.33,3,,1985,2977

This bird had a black mask that narrowed significantly as it reached the eye and met the bill, but the mask did not cover the top of the bill, as it would if this bird had been a Loggerhead Shrike.  A Loggerhead would have had a thicker mask and it would have spread more extensively over the eye and bill.  Notice in the photos that this bird also had the white markings around the eye distinctive in Northern, the thick white stripe bordering the top of the mask. This adult bird also showed the barring that is characteristic of a Northern adult, but only found on Loggerheads as immatures.  One last detail that we felt made this a Northern - the bill had a pale base, which would usually have be all black on a Loggerhead.  For anyone looking for this bird, we found her/him in the first parking lot of the River Slough Tract (the parking lot at the very beginning of the tract) on top of a short bush being chased by a Red-bellied Woodpecker.  She then flew across the road atop other small bushes adjacent the road, then to the phone wire. We watched as she hunted in the part of the tract that is still open to the public, but at one point she flew deep into the area only accessible to hunters right now.",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,4.00,5,,722,1090

Both Sam Hough and I were able to get photos of the bird.  After reviewing the photos at home and consulting a number of books, I am convinced this is an immature Northern Shrike rather than an immature Loggerhead Shrike.  Characteristics that support this conclusion are:  * At this time of the year, an immature Loggerhead Shrike should have fairly close to adult plumage; this bird has retained some of its juvenile characteristics, and the plumage is quite different than that of an adult.  * Brown head with narrow mask that does not extend above the middle of the eyes; mask thinner in front of the eyes; white eye ring fairly easily seen.  * Bill not as long as what you would see in an adult; extensive pale area at base of lower mandible.  * Back has no barring and has a light brown tint.  * Very obvious light brown tint scaling on breast, belly and flanks (not barring like a juvenile Loggerhead Shrike).",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,3.75,4,,742,1076

Showed up in middle of previously reported open area around 0958 after not being detected during my first walk around the perimeter of the area, then stayed in view for approximately the next hour before disappearing again. Initially seen perched on top of a tree here (39.9025164, -122.0727698), then flew to a couple trees nearby during my visit.   Large shrike - seemed larger than LOSH, though hard to judge without side-by-side comparison; substantial dark bill with pronounced hook to upper mandible, paler towards base; white over top of base of bill; weaker black mask than LOSH - more prominent behind the eye (a little bit wider than one eye width and about as long as two eye widths) than in front of it, and with white completely surrounding the eye, almost like spectacles; black eye; gray from crown to rump; rump whitish; upper tail black; whitish/very pale underparts with warm wash and fine barring from breast to belly that appeared maroon or brownish in my scope; black wings with small white wing patch and white tips to (secondaries/tertials?) and very thin pale tips to primaries; whitish utcs; black legs; underside of tail appeared mostly white due to white (tail spots?), though I never saw the tail spread well. [Notes taken before looking at my photos or field guide.]  After spending some time perched at the top of a tree, the shrike laddered down through the branches and then dove down into some nearby low bushes. It quickly maneuvered through them before flying back up to the tree holding what appeared to be a very downy and gray bird chick in its bill. After impaling the presumed chick on one of the branches, it proceeded to rip it up and eat the whole thing. Shortly after this, it started vocalizing spontaneously for the first time during my observation. I believe I heard and recorded at least three different types of vocalizations, which was extremely cool. It then spent the remainder of my observation generally preening, cleaning its bill against branches and surveying its realm before making a short flight and then disappearing.  All in all, I'm not sure if I've had a more prolonged and satisfying experience with a single bird in California since I started birding. Stoked the gamble of driving all the way up here for this bird paid off.  Photos. Audio. Video.",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,4.00,3,,2094,3141

This is an adult bird with no brown of the immature shrike and has a strongly gray wavy thin lines on a lighter gray underside.The upper-parts are paler compared to the medium blue-gray upper-parts of a Loggerhead Shrike.

The face pattern was somewhat more complex but also weaker than that of a Loggerhead Shrike.  The mask was conspicuously narrow and essentially restricted to an elongate region of dull, blackish that extended from just behind the eye across the auriculars, though there was at least some darker coloration extending under the eye and into the lores.  Contrasting with the dark mask was the rich buff-forehead that connected with a buffy supraloral stripe and complete eyering.  I noted no blackish coloration in front of or above the eye, so the upper edge of the mask extended from the eyering back along the upper edge of the auriculars before curving around their rear terminus and then continuing back forward along the lower edge of the auriculars and less conspicuously the moustachial region.  The crown, nape, and back and sides of the neck were uniformly medium-brown with a gray cast, with the brown of the sides of the neck curving around to demarcate the rear terminus of the auriculars and then extend down to the sides of the breast.  The back and scapulars were similarly colored, but with the distal scapulars having a relatively narrow and diffuse crescent of pale-buff.  The closed wings appeared to be entirely dull black apart from narrow tips of white to the secondaries just above the slightly lighter and more brownish wingtip.  In fact, I had a hard time distinguishing the coverts and remiges in the closed wing.  It was only when the bird spread its wing to preen that I noted a narrow band of creamy-buff along the bases of primaries that appeared uniformly paler and more brownish than the rest of the wing.  The upper part of the rump was the same color as the back, but the grayish-brown blended to creamy-buff on the lower rump and possibly also the uppertail coverts.  The upperside of the closed tail was blackish much like the wings, but when the tail was spread I noted a whitish margin even when seen from above.  When seen from below, the outer rectrices were extensively white, at least along their outer edges, but when the bird spread its tail I noted that the white curved around the outer edges distally, though I did not think it reached the central feathers.  Contrasting with the darker upperparts, the underparts were generally light gray, though with the malar and submoustachial regions buffy, and a brownish wash to the sides of the breast and the rear flanks.  Also apparent across the breast, sides, belly, and flanks was dusky barring that was relatively narrow, well-defined, and with a wavy appearance.  The undertail coverts were more purely whitish and apparently unmarked, but I am less sure about both the color and pattern on the throat.

My first of this species in the state.  I found this bird (not until about 20 minutes after I arrives) about halfway between the little pond with the ""W"" sign and the red barn up the hill that it was reported behind.  It was near the road in a thicket.  It flew towards the house and feeders behind the pond.  It then flew back towards me, landing in the brambles just behind my parked car, at the ""W"" sign.  I got real good photos but a passing box truck spooked it.  It disappeared for a while but was seen again making roughly the same circuit about an hour later.

Possibly younger bird harassing older bird for food. Both birds seen together, one at one point with feathers in bill suggesting recent kill or feed.   Thick bold black eyestripe on soft grey face, width of eye only, slightly curved downwards before nape; cheeks whiter than pale grey breast, which was crossed with faint (but clear) slightly scalloped darker bars.

I got very lucky, since I was actually standing under the tree when it flew up once, and it apparently didn't notice me, so I got great views of it. Appeared to be an adult, classic shrike appearance with long tail, gray body, black mask, and black wings with white patches on them.

Showed up in middle of previously reported open area around 0958 after not being detected during my first walk around the perimeter of the area, then stayed in view for approximately the next hour before disappearing again. Initially seen perched on top of a tree here (39.9025164, -122.0727698), then flew to a couple trees nearby during my visit.   Large shrike - seemed larger than LOSH, though hard to judge without side-by-side comparison; substantial dark bill with pronounced hook to upper mandible, paler towards base; white over top of base of bill; weaker black mask than LOSH - more prominent behind the eye (a little bit wider than one eye width and about as long as two eye widths) than in front of it, and with white completely surrounding the eye, almost like spectacles; black eye; gray from crown to rump; rump whitish; upper tail black; whitish/very pale underparts with warm wash and fine barring from breast to belly that appeared maroon or brownish in my scope; black wings with small white wing patch and white tips to (secondaries/tertials?) and very thin pale tips to primaries; whitish utcs; black legs; underside of tail appeared mostly white due to white (tail spots?), though I never saw the tail spread well. [Notes taken before looking at my photos or field guide.]  After spending some time perched at the top of a tree, the shrike laddered down through the branches and then dove down into some nearby low bushes. It quickly maneuvered through them before flying back up to the tree holding what appeared to be a very downy and gray bird chick in its bill. After impaling the presumed chick on one of the branches, it proceeded to rip it up and eat the whole thing. Shortly after this, it started vocalizing spontaneously for the first time during my observation. I believe I heard and recorded at least three different types of vocalizations, which was extremely cool. It then spent the remainder of my observation generally preening, cleaning its bill against branches and surveying its realm before making a short flight and then disappearing.  All in all, I'm not sure if I've had a more prolonged and satisfying experience with a single bird in California since I started birding. Stoked the gamble of driving all the way up here for this bird paid off.  Photos. Audio. Video.",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,4.00,2,,1498,2247

Yesterday's  scenario was particularly interesting.  The shrike was perched on a small branch about 2 feet above the ground in an undisturbed area of snow.  The bird would be sitting casually but then look down on the ground in a specific area like he was ready to plunge head first into the snow.  He made this notion about 3 times before finally plunging down in the snow at about a 45 degree angle and pulling out the shrew.  The bird clearly could hear the shrew under the snow and was able to pinpoint it's location. I always thought shrikes hunted strictly by sight, but apparently they are also able to locate prey by sound underneath the snow as well.  The attack was vicious indeed, the bird repeatedly striking the shrew in the head and face and then finally administering the fatal bite to the back of the neck.  The pictures below are of another shrew it pulled off my rock landscaped wall and brought it underneath the bird feeders in an open area to kill it.",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,4.00,2,,2592,3888

It had a relatively stout bill that tapered from a heavy base to a tip that was blunt, if not slightly hooked, and which would have extended backward on the face to a point about halfway between the eye and the rear edge of the auriculars.  The forehead was relatively steep, and the crown was strongly rounded with a peak that was above and maybe a little behind the eye.  Typical of a shrike, this bird had a proportionately large head, a short and inconspicuous neck, and a plump and full-chested body with a posture that was closer to horizontal than diagonal.  The medium-length wings were typically held over the back, but at least once this bird lowered them enough for me to see the rump.  I thought the primary projection was between one-third and one-half the length of the exposed secondaries, and the wingtips appeared to reach right about to the tips of the uppertail coverts.  The tail was at least as long as the body, but it may have been as long as the body and head combined.  When held closed, the tail was parallel-sided, but when spread slightly the outer feathers appeared to be somewhat shorter than the central pair, resulting in the tail having a broadly rounded tip.  The legs and feet were unremarkable in their length and mass. This bird’s plumage patterns were typical of a North American shrike given a dark mask, grayish upperparts, mostly black wings and tail, and pale underparts.  I further noted that the forehead, crown, nape, back, and scapulars were medium-gray with a distinct brownish cast.  Demarcating the lower edge of the gray crown was a narrow and relatively indistinct supercilium that extended through the supraloral region to meet an eyering of the same color.  Also apparent was a well-defined band of buff across the immediate forehead that narrowly separated the bill from the gray crown.  The lores were relatively pale, yet I think they were darker than the supraloral region and the eyering.  The blackish “mask” was narrow and largely restricted to the auriculars, across which it extended behind the eye with the upper edge representing a sharp line that continued backward along the upper edge of the auriculars to a rounded terminus along their rear edge, and the lower edge extending from just below the eye back along the lower edge of the auriculars.  The pale color of the throat therefore extended up to the loral region and the lower edge of the auriculars.  The throat, breast, sides, and flanks generally appeared to be light gray with a somewhat uneven appearance; however, close inspection revealed narrow, dusky barring across at least the breast and sides. Returning to the upperparts, the back and scapulars were about the same shade of medium-gray and with the same brownish cast as the cap.  Narrowly separating the gray back from the black wings was a whitish crescent along the lower edge of the scapulars that appeared to be slightly broader rearward, where it curved around the inner part of the closed wing.  Although I noted little if any white in the remiges on this bird, there was a relatively strong contrast between the medium-brown remiges and what appeared to be jet-black greater-coverts.  A contrast on the median coverts between blackish centers and pale fringes created a scaly pattern near the shoulder that I missed in the field.  I noted just enough pale fringing on the tips of the exposed primaries to distinguish the various feathers in the wingtip.  The rump appeared to be creamy-white with a brownish cast centrally.  The upperside of the tail appeared to be dusky as opposed to uniformly black, and when spread, it had white edges across the distal third or so that were broader at the corners than internally. The bill was mostly black with a paler base, and the eyes were dark, but the legs and what I could see of the feet appeared to be blackish.",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,3.33,3,,2112,2816

Noticed shrike still to NE. 2 Bluejays were making very weird sounds - including a quasi peregrine sound in the hedgerow area so I went to check this out and all of a sudden shrike was back. I figured I had not seen it come back behind me. I took more pictures. When I got home, I realized I had two different birds: One Immature and one adult. The Immature was browner in tone, incomplete mask, lighter base of bill and slightly brown barring on chest. Adult was stark white and gray with solid black mask.

We both got on the bird and after taking several photos I posted the bird to our local text group. Eventually, Scotty Baldinger and Patrick Dechon joined us. The bird moved between a couple of treetops and eventually flew down into the dense underbrush. I noted I had seen amole/mouse working the leaf litter under there just a short time before. Eventually, about 15 minutes later the bird flew up into a tree. It cleaned its bill several times on a branch indicating to me it had eaten something.

Both times he flew noticed lots of wing flashing that reminded me of a mocking bird, but the silhouette was blockier compared to a mockingbirds sleek silhouette, After he flew down after the second sighting I didn't see him for a long while.

In a normal spring the expected shrike by now would be Loggerhead, although there have been recent reports of Northerns. I was partly influenced by that and also the bill seemed small with a smaller hook than is seen in Northerns. But I consulted five guides: Sibley, National Geographic, Peterson, Stokes and Floyd. These guides rather consistently show that for Loggerhead the black of the mask should definitely go above the eye, and the area immediately over the top of the bill should be black. In the photos here, the area above the bill is whitish and the black of the mask does not encompass the top of the eye. There is also the matter of the darkness of the gray in the back and its contrast with the black of the wings and tail. Judging that in the field or in photos is tricky because of lighting.",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,5.00,1,,1390,1736

The face pattern was somewhat more complex but also weaker than that of a Loggerhead Shrike.  The mask was conspicuously narrow and essentially restricted to an elongate region of dull, blackish that extended from just behind the eye across the auriculars, though there was at least some darker coloration extending under the eye and into the lores.  Contrasting with the dark mask was the rich buff-forehead that connected with a buffy supraloral stripe and complete eyering.  I noted no blackish coloration in front of or above the eye, so the upper edge of the mask extended from the eyering back along the upper edge of the auriculars before curving around their rear terminus and then continuing back forward along the lower edge of the auriculars and less conspicuously the moustachial region.  The crown, nape, and back and sides of the neck were uniformly medium-brown with a gray cast, with the brown of the sides of the neck curving around to demarcate the rear terminus of the auriculars and then extend down to the sides of the breast.  The back and scapulars were similarly colored, but with the distal scapulars having a relatively narrow and diffuse crescent of pale-buff.  The closed wings appeared to be entirely dull black apart from narrow tips of white to the secondaries just above the slightly lighter and more brownish wingtip.  In fact, I had a hard time distinguishing the coverts and remiges in the closed wing.  It was only when the bird spread its wing to preen that I noted a narrow band of creamy-buff along the bases of primaries that appeared uniformly paler and more brownish than the rest of the wing.  The upper part of the rump was the same color as the back, but the grayish-brown blended to creamy-buff on the lower rump and possibly also the uppertail coverts.  The upperside of the closed tail was blackish much like the wings, but when the tail was spread I noted a whitish margin even when seen from above.  When seen from below, the outer rectrices were extensively white, at least along their outer edges, but when the bird spread its tail I noted that the white curved around the outer edges distally, though I did not think it reached the central feathers.  Contrasting with the darker upperparts, the underparts were generally light gray, though with the malar and submoustachial regions buffy, and a brownish wash to the sides of the breast and the rear flanks.  Also apparent across the breast, sides, belly, and flanks was dusky barring that was relatively narrow, well-defined, and with a wavy appearance.  The undertail coverts were more purely whitish and apparently unmarked, but I am less sure about both the color and pattern on the throat.  The bill was generally blackish but with the basal half or so of the lower mandible either pinkish or fleshy.  The eyes were dark, but I was unable to see any color.  What I was able to see of the legs and feet was black.",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,3.33,3,,,

Showed up in middle of previously reported open area around 0958 after not being detected during my first walk around the perimeter of the area, then stayed in view for approximately the next hour before disappearing again. Initially seen perched on top of a tree here (39.9025164, -122.0727698), then flew to a couple trees nearby during my visit.   Large shrike - seemed larger than LOSH, though hard to judge without side-by-side comparison; substantial dark bill with pronounced hook to upper mandible, paler towards base; white over top of base of bill; weaker black mask than LOSH - more prominent behind the eye (a little bit wider than one eye width and about as long as two eye widths) than in front of it, and with white completely surrounding the eye, almost like spectacles; black eye; gray from crown to rump; rump whitish; upper tail black; whitish/very pale underparts with warm wash and fine barring from breast to belly that appeared maroon or brownish in my scope; black wings with small white wing patch and white tips to (secondaries/tertials?) and very thin pale tips to primaries; whitish utcs; black legs; underside of tail appeared mostly white due to white (tail spots?), though I never saw the tail spread well. [Notes taken before looking at my photos or field guide.]  After spending some time perched at the top of a tree, the shrike laddered down through the branches and then dove down into some nearby low bushes. It quickly maneuvered through them before flying back up to the tree holding what appeared to be a very downy and gray bird chick in its bill. After impaling the presumed chick on one of the branches, it proceeded to rip it up and eat the whole thing. Shortly after this, it started vocalizing spontaneously for the first time during my observation. I believe I heard and recorded at least three different types of vocalizations, which was extremely cool. It then spent the remainder of my observation generally preening, cleaning its bill against branches and surveying its realm before making a short flight and then disappearing.  All in all, I'm not sure if I've had a more prolonged and satisfying experience with a single bird in California since I started birding. Stoked the gamble of driving all the way up here for this bird paid off.  Photos. Audio. Video.",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,3.50,2,,3334,4999

Though it had the basic look of a shrike, it was also clearly different.  The head was just a bit smaller and rounder in proportion to the body; the bird looked long - not as stocky as I think of a Loggerhead Shrikes as being; rather on the brown side of gray - not clear black, gray and white; it lacked a clear black mask.  The bill did not look especially long.  Thankfully it stayed put for a couple of photos, good enough for identification (attached).  In the photos, barring on the breast and the pale base of the lower mandible can be discerned.  A juvenile-plumaged bird.  The shrike was first perched near the top of some sunflower stalks.  It then flew to a two-foot tall stem along the road where we were walking, then continued into the sunflower/dogbane meadow not to be found again.  There were plenty of sparrows present - potential prey.  It was silent.",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,3.50,2,,724,1086

Both Sam Hough and I were able to get photos of the bird.  After reviewing the photos at home and consulting a number of books, I am convinced this is an immature Northern Shrike rather than an immature Loggerhead Shrike.  Characteristics that support this conclusion are:  * At this time of the year, an immature Loggerhead Shrike should have fairly close to adult plumage; this bird has retained some of its juvenile characteristics, and the plumage is quite different than that of an adult.  * Brown head with narrow mask that does not extend above the middle of the eyes; mask thinner in front of the eyes; white eye ring fairly easily seen.  * Bill not as long as what you would see in an adult; extensive pale area at base of lower mandible.  * Back has no barring and has a light brown tint.  * Very obvious light brown tint scaling on breast, belly and flanks (not barring like a juvenile Loggerhead Shrike).",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,3.50,2,,1032,1383

OBSERVERS: Day one, Debby and Jim Parker and maybe Debbie House later. The next day Steve Brad and Tom Heindel saw it in the morning. Then on Friday, Bill Mitchel and Susan and Bob Steele had it. It was photographed by Steve Brad on Sunday, so it stayed for 6 days at least. HABITAT: Grazed grasslands with native vegetation and trees mostly along the river. The area had been burned in the past as many of the native Cottonwoods were blackened and pruned by fire. The river is bordered by cattails. There are at least three small pools formed by artesian wells but the cows use them for drinking so it’s messy. But in general the area is used for breeding by native birds later in the year. SHAPE AND SIZE: Shrike shaped but maybe longer looking, not so compact. Longish bill with obvious hook at the tip of upper mandible. The mask on the face was more narrow than on a Loggerhead Shrike (LOSH) and did not go over the round dark eye. The tail seemed long.  BEHAVIOR: Jim commented that when not using binoculars, it looked ghostly as it flew from one perch to another. It was difficult to relocate as it blended in and was similar in color to the silvery cottonwoods. At one point it went to the sandy-ground in between sage brush on a hillside nearby and must have been looking for food. It mostly stayed medium height and a few times lost itself in the highest limbs of a budding cottonwood, making it difficult to refind. We would refind it when it moved Documented for NAB",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,3.50,2,,769,625

All of adults, unlike the SY bird seen last week. Presumably all the same individual - but who knows? Seen in quite the range of locations along the creek and near the sewage lagoon; specific sightings all noted below. First seen at 0937, when it flew low over the stream corridor in the E end of reach 4 from somewhere upstream and landed in an alder ca 200 m downstream of the boundary fence, at the S edge of the riparian shrub zone. Remained until 0940; I did not see it depart. At 1007, reappeared just E of reach 4 and perched for less than 1 minute in an isolated, mostly-dead Chokecherry S of the creek, then it flew to an alder along the creek. At 1009 it flew upstream, low, and I lost sight of it somewhere in reach 4 - it had flown when a BBMA was in flight in the vicinity. I was not positive but did suspect that the magpie was perhaps chasing it away. A magpie (the same?) then perched in the alder where the shrike had been (photos of both magpie and shrike here). I spotted the shrike again near the E end of reach 4 from 1039 to 1046, apparently actively hunting, frequently changing perches. During this time it remained in an area within 100 m of the point where the E boundary intersects the stream. It perched near the top of living shrubs 4 times, dead shrubs 3 times, on a wire tree cage once, on or near a lump on the ground once, and at 3 different spots in a small area on the barbed wire fence. I last saw it perched along the stream ca 100 m upstream of me. Seen again at 1057 in the same E part of reach 4, perching in the tops of alders along the stream. I first detected it this time by movement low near some alders upstream of me. Apparently still hunting. Seemed fearless and flew to a perch ca 20 m from me, then another farther downstream. I wondered if it might actually be using my presence with the possibility that I might flush a rodent. No observations except frequent shrike sightings during the survey lent evidence for this hypothesis. At 1236, I saw the shrike perched in the alder snag just N of the diversion. At 1238, after defecating once and scratching its body briefly with its right foot it flew ca 100 m downstream and perched at the top of a live alder. It was still visible in the vicinity at 1247, perched in a shrub ca 200 m downstream of the diversion. Shrike again glimpsed briefly at 1318, ca 150 m above the rocky draw, perched and then dropping down (to the ground?) near low Chokecherries S of the stream. Saw it shortly after hearing SOSP ""chimp"" calls, which continued as I observed the shrike. Ca 1542, the shrike flew up from a dense willow area ca 50 m below the photo point and perched in a Russian-olive, then flew back down to the willow area and out of sight, ca 1 minute later. (just after the survey end, at 1607, I saw the shrike again, perched in a small Russian-olive ca 20 m E of the sewage lagoon fence, then flying ca 100 m SE to another Russian-olive).",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,3.50,2,,3456,4608

All of adults, unlike the SY bird seen last week. Presumably all the same individual - but who knows? Seen in quite the range of locations along the creek and near the sewage lagoon; specific sightings all noted below. First seen at 0937, when it flew low over the stream corridor in the E end of reach 4 from somewhere upstream and landed in an alder ca 200 m downstream of the boundary fence, at the S edge of the riparian shrub zone. Remained until 0940; I did not see it depart. At 1007, reappeared just E of reach 4 and perched for less than 1 minute in an isolated, mostly-dead Chokecherry S of the creek, then it flew to an alder along the creek. At 1009 it flew upstream, low, and I lost sight of it somewhere in reach 4 - it had flown when a BBMA was in flight in the vicinity. I was not positive but did suspect that the magpie was perhaps chasing it away. A magpie (the same?) then perched in the alder where the shrike had been (photos of both magpie and shrike here). I spotted the shrike again near the E end of reach 4 from 1039 to 1046, apparently actively hunting, frequently changing perches. During this time it remained in an area within 100 m of the point where the E boundary intersects the stream. It perched near the top of living shrubs 4 times, dead shrubs 3 times, on a wire tree cage once, on or near a lump on the ground once, and at 3 different spots in a small area on the barbed wire fence. I last saw it perched along the stream ca 100 m upstream of me. Seen again at 1057 in the same E part of reach 4, perching in the tops of alders along the stream. I first detected it this time by movement low near some alders upstream of me. Apparently still hunting. Seemed fearless and flew to a perch ca 20 m from me, then another farther downstream. I wondered if it might actually be using my presence with the possibility that I might flush a rodent. No observations except frequent shrike sightings during the survey lent evidence for this hypothesis. At 1236, I saw the shrike perched in the alder snag just N of the diversion. At 1238, after defecating once and scratching its body briefly with its right foot it flew ca 100 m downstream and perched at the top of a live alder.

Yesterday's  scenario was particularly interesting.  The shrike was perched on a small branch about 2 feet above the ground in an undisturbed area of snow.  The bird would be sitting casually but then look down on the ground in a specific area like he was ready to plunge head first into the snow.  He made this notion about 3 times before finally plunging down in the snow at about a 45 degree angle and pulling out the shrew.  The bird clearly could hear the shrew under the snow and was able to pinpoint it's location. I always thought shrikes hunted strictly by sight, but apparently they are also able to locate prey by sound underneath the snow as well.  The attack was vicious indeed, the bird repeatedly striking the shrew in the head and face and then finally administering the fatal bite to the back of the neck.  The pictures below are of another shrew it pulled off my rock landscaped wall and brought it underneath the bird feeders in an open area to kill it.",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,3.50,2,,2340,3188

After about a half hour or so, Eric drove down to the clump of willows that intersected Monte Vista Road, finding the bird shortly thereafter. We all moved to that spot on Monte Vista, where I eventually saw the bird. At first it appeared perched on the willows, then dropped down to the fenceline, quickly flying to a perpendicular fenceline some distance away. To my eye, the bird appeared to have a lightly brownish cast, as if someone had put a dash of coffee into a cup of cream. Fine vermiculations were visible on the underparts. The mask was poorly developed. The bird appeared to have a large bill with distinct hook, and the mandible was light.

In my opinion this bird (NSHR) can be differentiated from Loggerhead Shrike by thinner black mask with a very visible white line above mask and above eye and across base of bill. Black mask was much thinner between eye and bill (lores). Mask hooked downward at nape. Bill was longer and more strongly hooked than one would expect for a Loggerhead. First third of lower mandible was a pale blond brown color. Upper mandible showed some pale areas as well near the base.  This pale area covering the base of lower mandible is more typical of NSHR. Loggerheads typically have all black bills. Breast and belly showed prominent grayish barring with a strong brownish cast. Young Loggerheads can show barring on breast but not to this degree and if they have barring on breast then back is barred as well. This bird shows a smooth light gray color on back and crown. No contrast between gray of crown and gray back. In Loggerhead the crown would typically be darker. Furthermore most immature Loggerheads would not show barring at this time of year. This bird also distinguished itself from Loggerhead behaviorally by perching almost exclusively (at least during the times I observed the bird) at the top of tall deciduous trees dropping to the ground periodically to hunt. Almost always the bird would reappear at the top of yet another deciduous tree. The bird was also observed to pump its tail with fair frequency. Many photos taken but lighting and distance were problematic. <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/34227153@N06/23951578095/in/dateposted-ff/"" title=""Shrike 12-24-15""><img src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5835/23951578095_75c5a05776.jpg"" alt=""Shrike 12-24-15"" /></a> <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/34227153@N06/23627323669/in/photostream/"" title=""Nshr""><img src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1441/23627323669_711db98010_z.jpg"" alt=""Nshr"" /></a>",Lanius borealis,norshr4,Species,20872,,3.50,2,,412,330
