Corneliussen and Cochranes. We had been at the feeders for almost 50 minutes since the bird was last seen by others, when I heard ""chimp"" calls from the butterfly bush just to the east of the feeders. Shortly thereafter, the bird came to the main feeder in the middle of the yard and fed with ANHUs a total of four separate times over the next 11 minutes, always announcing its presence by calling. First appearing at 8:53 am and and not seen after it fed last, at 9:04 am. Bob and I departed shortly thereafter.  Clearly a female-plumaged Archilochus hummingbird -  Primaries: Photos show strong sharp taper to P6, often times being described as appearing “cut off.” Other primaries narrower than BCHU. Specifically, P4 and P5 are somewhat tapered and not rounded as would be expected of female-plumaged BCHU. Hint of notch on inner web of inner primaries can be seen in photo ML260623411, which supports RTHU. Narrowing outer web of P10 also supports RTHU and can be seen in photos ML260623221, ML260684201, and ML260623281 when zoomed way in.  Other field notes: Dusky auricular and white post-ocular spot. Bill is also shorter, straighter, and less decurved than female BCHU. One thing that was notable for this bird in the field was it seemed more contrasting (deep green above, darker wings, brighter white below, golden green on crown), versus overall duskiness of BCHU. Tail noticeably longer past tips of primaries, but this is not necessarily diagnostic. Behavior: At one point it was facing me and hovering in flight with tail feathers flared while facing off with an ANHU. I watched the bird more and noted that as it flew it did not engage in tail pumping/flicking behavior often attributed to BCHU in flight. Wish I got a photo/video of that, but just as I turned my camera to video settings the bird took off. 4th MRN Co. record and the first one away from the feeders at K. Hansen's Gallery (per eBird), as others have noted.   *CBRC Accepted Record #2020-085  Literature consulted: https://birdersjournal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hummingbird-id.pdf",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.94,16,"",2319,3478

The other 2 main feeders are mostly blocked from the road, but can be sorta seen at the right angle (they’re hanging on the house near the right side).  She often perches on the telephone wire and hangs around the lilac bush. Also, my neighbour has a feeder up as well which should be visible from the road.

Corneliussen and Cochranes. We had been at the feeders for almost 50 minutes since the bird was last seen by others, when I heard ""chimp"" calls from the butterfly bush just to the east of the feeders. Shortly thereafter, the bird came to the main feeder in the middle of the yard and fed with ANHUs a total of four separate times over the next 11 minutes, always announcing its presence by calling. First appearing at 8:53 am and and not seen after it fed last, at 9:04 am. Bob and I departed shortly thereafter.  Clearly a female-plumaged Archilochus hummingbird -  Primaries: Photos show strong sharp taper to P6, often times being described as appearing “cut off.” Other primaries narrower than BCHU. Specifically, P4 and P5 are somewhat tapered and not rounded as would be expected of female-plumaged BCHU. Hint of notch on inner web of inner primaries can be seen in photo ML260623411, which supports RTHU. Narrowing outer web of P10 also supports RTHU and can be seen in photos ML260623221, ML260684201, and ML260623281 when zoomed way in.  Other field notes: Dusky auricular and white post-ocular spot. Bill is also shorter, straighter, and less decurved than female BCHU. One thing that was notable for this bird in the field was it seemed more contrasting (deep green above, darker wings, brighter white below, golden green on crown), versus overall duskiness of BCHU. Tail noticeably longer past tips of primaries, but this is not necessarily diagnostic. Behavior: At one point it was facing me and hovering in flight with tail feathers flared while facing off with an ANHU. I watched the bird more and noted that as it flew it did not engage in tail pumping/flicking behavior often attributed to BCHU in flight. Wish I got a photo/video of that, but just as I turned my camera to video settings the bird took off. 4th MRN Co. record and the first one away from the feeders at K.

Corneliussen and Cochranes. We had been at the feeders for almost 50 minutes since the bird was last seen by others, when I heard ""chimp"" calls from the butterfly bush just to the east of the feeders. Shortly thereafter, the bird came to the main feeder in the middle of the yard and fed with ANHUs a total of four separate times over the next 11 minutes, always announcing its presence by calling. First appearing at 8:53 am and and not seen after it fed last, at 9:04 am. Bob and I departed shortly thereafter.  Clearly a female-plumaged Archilochus hummingbird -  Primaries: Photos show strong sharp taper to P6, often times being described as appearing “cut off.” Other primaries narrower than BCHU. Specifically, P4 and P5 are somewhat tapered and not rounded as would be expected of female-plumaged BCHU. Hint of notch on inner web of inner primaries can be seen in photo ML260623411, which supports RTHU. Narrowing outer web of P10 also supports RTHU and can be seen in photos ML260623221, ML260684201, and ML260623281 when zoomed way in.  Other field notes: Dusky auricular and white post-ocular spot. Bill is also shorter, straighter, and less decurved than female BCHU. One thing that was notable for this bird in the field was it seemed more contrasting (deep green above, darker wings, brighter white below, golden green on crown), versus overall duskiness of BCHU. Tail noticeably longer past tips of primaries, but this is not necessarily diagnostic. Behavior: At one point it was facing me and hovering in flight with tail feathers flared while facing off with an ANHU. I watched the bird more and noted that as it flew it did not engage in tail pumping/flicking behavior often attributed to BCHU in flight. Wish I got a photo/video of that, but just as I turned my camera to video settings the bird took off. 4th MRN Co. record and the first one away from the feeders at K. Hansen's Gallery (per eBird), as others have noted.   *CBRC Accepted Record #2020-085  Literature consulted: https://birdersjournal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hummingbird-id.pdf",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.75,8,"",2099,3149

With all the on and off showers this morning, male making frequent visits to feed on Penstemon. Often times on rainy days, with the Penstemon nectar being more abundant, ( my guess) I will often see them take more breaks. I'm guessing this is the same male from last year, as he will take breaks in the closest Serviceberry. Last year he would also take breaks on the metal plant cage, but the cage is no longer there. Female taking significantly less trips, but would spend more time in the Penstemon. Perhaps just a quick meal before heading back to sit on nest. I don't get much time to observe the females this time of year due to them being beyond busy with nesting and raising young. I usually get much more time with them after nesting season, as most of the males are gone ( At least from the areas I observe them).",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,5.00,6,,,

Corneliussen and Cochranes. We had been at the feeders for almost 50 minutes since the bird was last seen by others, when I heard ""chimp"" calls from the butterfly bush just to the east of the feeders. Shortly thereafter, the bird came to the main feeder in the middle of the yard and fed with ANHUs a total of four separate times over the next 11 minutes, always announcing its presence by calling. First appearing at 8:53 am and and not seen after it fed last, at 9:04 am. Bob and I departed shortly thereafter.  Clearly a female-plumaged Archilochus hummingbird -  Primaries: Photos show strong sharp taper to P6, often times being described as appearing “cut off.” Other primaries narrower than BCHU. Specifically, P4 and P5 are somewhat tapered and not rounded as would be expected of female-plumaged BCHU. Hint of notch on inner web of inner primaries can be seen in photo ML260623411, which supports RTHU. Narrowing outer web of P10 also supports RTHU and can be seen in photos ML260623221, ML260684201, and ML260623281 when zoomed way in.  Other field notes: Dusky auricular and white post-ocular spot. Bill is also shorter, straighter, and less decurved than female BCHU. One thing that was notable for this bird in the field was it seemed more contrasting (deep green above, darker wings, brighter white below, golden green on crown), versus overall duskiness of BCHU. Tail noticeably longer past tips of primaries, but this is not necessarily diagnostic. Behavior: At one point it was facing me and hovering in flight with tail feathers flared while facing off with an ANHU. I watched the bird more and noted that as it flew it did not engage in tail pumping/flicking behavior often attributed to BCHU in flight. Wish I got a photo/video of that, but just as I turned my camera to video settings the bird took off. 4th MRN Co. record and the first one away from the feeders at K.

These all indicated a Black-chinned (BCHU) or Ruby-throated (RTHU). I asked Brad to photograph the bird so we could check for potential Ruby-throated Hmmingbirds and distinguish how many different BCHUs were present, as this spcecies is considered rare locally after early September.  The photos showed the inner primaries were much narrower than outer primaries, confirming the bird as an Archilochus hummingbird. Of much greater interest, the photos showed that  the tip of  p10 was much narrower and more pointed that typically shown by BCHU and a feature consistent with RTHU. In addition, the bird was much brighter green above than the BCHUs seen, that day, another feature favoring RTHU.  Analysis of the photos and further field observations confirmed the identification as RTHU using the following criteria:  1.Narrow tip to p10 rather than blunt tip. 2. Notches on the inner primaries (e,g, p6), which are shown by RTHU but not BCHU. 3. In the tail, R4 was longer than R3, which again favors RTHU 4. The tips of the tail feathers were rounded, whereas BCHU tends to show a nipple shape to the ends of tail-feathers 5. The extension of the tail past the wing-tips was quite noticeable, which again favors RTHU. 6. The bill was straight and shorter compared to the longer, slightly decurved bills of the BCHU seen. 7. The bright green upperparts reaching all the way to the forehead is typical of RTHU, whereas most BCHUs, including those present, showed dull dirty green upperparts with the forecrown and forehead being grayish brown.",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.75,4,,996,1494

Corneliussen and Cochranes. We had been at the feeders for almost 50 minutes since the bird was last seen by others, when I heard ""chimp"" calls from the butterfly bush just to the east of the feeders. Shortly thereafter, the bird came to the main feeder in the middle of the yard and fed with ANHUs a total of four separate times over the next 11 minutes, always announcing its presence by calling. First appearing at 8:53 am and and not seen after it fed last, at 9:04 am. Bob and I departed shortly thereafter.  Clearly a female-plumaged Archilochus hummingbird -  Primaries: Photos show strong sharp taper to P6, often times being described as appearing “cut off.” Other primaries narrower than BCHU. Specifically, P4 and P5 are somewhat tapered and not rounded as would be expected of female-plumaged BCHU. Hint of notch on inner web of inner primaries can be seen in photo ML260623411, which supports RTHU. Narrowing outer web of P10 also supports RTHU and can be seen in photos ML260623221, ML260684201, and ML260623281 when zoomed way in.  Other field notes: Dusky auricular and white post-ocular spot. Bill is also shorter, straighter, and less decurved than female BCHU. One thing that was notable for this bird in the field was it seemed more contrasting (deep green above, darker wings, brighter white below, golden green on crown), versus overall duskiness of BCHU. Tail noticeably longer past tips of primaries, but this is not necessarily diagnostic. Behavior: At one point it was facing me and hovering in flight with tail feathers flared while facing off with an ANHU. I watched the bird more and noted that as it flew it did not engage in tail pumping/flicking behavior often attributed to BCHU in flight. Wish I got a photo/video of that, but just as I turned my camera to video settings the bird took off. 4th MRN Co. record and the first one away from the feeders at K. Hansen's Gallery (per eBird), as others have noted.   *CBRC Accepted Record #2020-085  Literature consulted: https://birdersjournal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hummingbird-id.pdf",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.20,5,"",1816,2724

With all the on and off showers this morning, male making frequent visits to feed on Penstemon. Often times on rainy days, with the Penstemon nectar being more abundant, ( my guess) I will often see them take more breaks. I'm guessing this is the same male from last year, as he will take breaks in the closest Serviceberry. Last year he would also take breaks on the metal plant cage, but the cage is no longer there. Female taking significantly less trips, but would spend more time in the Penstemon. Perhaps just a quick meal before heading back to sit on nest. I don't get much time to observe the females this time of year due to them being beyond busy with nesting and raising young. I usually get much more time with them after nesting season, as most of the males are gone ( At least from the areas I observe them).",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,5.00,3,"",3056,6189

When I asked him what was up, he replied that he was trying to get a decent look at a small, non-Rufous Hummingbird.  I paused my area search, and we soon saw the bird feed briefly on the purple flowers.  Oscar quickly exclaimed “I think that might be a Ruby-throat!” but I was unsure.  My views had been brief and incomplete, and I thought that the throat looked too gray.  However, we radioed Jim to come out with the cameras (it being a slow, windy day I wasn’t carrying mine), which he did.  Since the bird had zoomed off, I decided it’d be best for me to quickly finish the area search while the other two looked for the hummingbird. 	When I returned, Oscar had the bird pinned down near the Coast Guard Tree, and was blazing away at it with my camera.  I studied it for about a minute through my binoculars, and was able to convince myself that it was, indeed, a Ruby-throated Hummingbird, a conclusion Oscar and Jim had already reached for themselves.  The next half hour or so was spent looking at the bird, trying to get photos (it was an elusive, quick-moving little bugger), and opening nets.  Eventually, I found the bird trapped in the Coast Guard net, and after extracting it, I took it in to the banding lab. 	Jim, Oscar and Jessie joined me there, and with their help, measured and photographed the bird.  Since we do not have a permit or the equipment to band hummingbirds, we released the bird unmarked after we had taken all the necessary biometric data and a series of photographs.  It flew off, and we never saw it again.  Description.  This bird was a small hummingbird, bright green above, and light gray below, with a white throat. 	Head: This bird had a bright, emerald-green crown and nape, contrasting with the clean grayish-white throat and black lores and dark gray auriculars.  The bill was long, straight and dark.  The lores were black, and distinctly arrowhead-shaped, swelling towards the eye, with no white above.  The auriculars were dark ashy-gray.  There was a small white post-ocular spot behind the eye. The sides of the neck were grayish, which wrapped around through the fore collar, to about halfway around the neck.  The throat below the area that would fill in to become the gorget was also white. 	Body: The bird had a completely bright, emerald green back and rump, which did not contrast with the crown.  The underparts were pale grayish-white, with some buffy edging to the flank feathers.  The undertail coverts were white. 	Tail: The tail was short, mostly green, and distinctly notched, which made the tail forked when the bird sat.  The tips of the rectrices were white, while the subterminal portions were black.   	Wings: The wings were black and long, reaching to the tip of the tail when folded.  The inner primaries were short and narrow, contrasting with the broader outer primaries.  The last primary, P10, narrowed toward the tip, giving the feather a scimitar shape, which was quite unlike the broad tip to the same feather that Black-chinned Hummingbirds have. 	Measurements: A suite of measurements were taken while the bird was in our banding lab.  Since Oscar Johnson has included these in his report, I will not repeat them here.  Discussion.  The bright, emerald-green back, shape of both the inner and outer primaries, as well as the face pattern rule out all other genera of North American hummingbirds than Archilochus, while the combination of measurements taken in-hand, the shape of the bill, and the length and shape of the primaries and tail effectively rule out Black-chinned Hummingbird.",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.20,5,,2592,3888

Regular visitor to the honeysuckle (every 30 minutes or less), had many various views, mostly in flight. Noted all of the same characteristics Alex did on 9/7. I took hundreds of photos and after an initial review will add that the tip of p10 appears consistent with RTHU (expected, given other field marks) - it does not have the broad club shaped tip typical of BCHU and appears relatively narrow/pointed in comparison. The short straight bill (for Archilochus), the strong contrasting head pattern (green cap, blackish face, very pale mostly clean throat) was very different than the BCHUs present here and that have been at my home feeders the last couple weeks. The BCHUs I have seen lately with paler throats/underparts were females that lacked any hint of a dark “mask” that stands out on this bird. Tail pumping was usually not done at all as the bird fed, though it did it very mildly on some occasions, but it was never really noticeable.   Photo review shows R4 slightly longer than R3 (should be vice versa on BCHU). Outer of web of P10 is very narrow and tapers toward the tip - this would appear wider and grow noticeably broader near the tip in BCHU. Inner primary tips appear ""cut off"" rather than blunt/rounded  I believe this is right in the prime window for RTHU in the state.",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.67,3,,1223,1840

It looks that the injured bill young male I photographed in the West sideyard patch has claimed that area as his, while the adult male is currently holding the backyard patch. I was so pleased to see an adult male!!  Generally, young males are around 90-95% of the hummer populous.... UNTIL winter has taken a step over the migrant period. Then the birds that remain are generally adult males with a few young males claiming territories - often temporarily- or becoming nomadic trespassers with occasional sightings. I like to believe that these adults could be returnees, as all young birds that would have been here previous years - along with past adults - would have had adult plumage after their first wintering season post hatching. This helps support that many of the adults may be returns this late in the year. Hummers are known for fidelity among sites and even behaviors, so experienced birds that overwinter in the US will generally continue to, even if it's not at the same locale; often time it is, and for years sometimes.",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.67,3,,2992,2992

Marantz on 10 November 2017 at Lake Tamarisk, Desert Center, Riverside County, California.","This was a notably small bird with a posture that was typical of a hummingbird.  The bill was long, slim, and tubular.  I further noted that the bill was very slightly decurved and just barely longer than the head was wide.  The forehead was sloping and the crown was gently rounded on a head that was unremarkable in size for a hummingbird.  The neck was short and inconspicuous, yet seemingly slimmer than that of an Anna’s Hummingbird.  I also thought this bird was a little slimmer and seemingly smaller than an Anna’s Hummingbird, but I never clearly saw the two species in direct comparison.  The wings were long and sickle-like with the primaries extending well beyond the secondaries in the closed wing and the wingtip having a stair-stepped appearance given the graduated primaries, but I failed to note both the primary projection and the placement of the wingtips relative to the tail.  I noted quite clearly that the tail was short and notched at the tip, with the corners tapering to relatively finely pointed tips, but I did not notice the length of the tail relative to field-marks on the body.  The undertail and uppertail coverts were both relatively long, yet both fell short of even the center of the tail.  The legs were short and the feet were quite small.  I really saw nothing on the spread wings of the flying bird that was all that useful apart from the fact that the wings were beating very rapidly, and that they were relatively long and slim. This was a colorful and well-marked bird.  I never clearly saw the forehead, but the crown, nape, and back and side of the neck were an iridescent, forest-green in color that was both relatively dark and seemingly with a blue component to the green.  The back, scapulars, and rump were also about this same shade of green, as apparently were the wing coverts located near the bird’s shoulder.  I thought the uppertail coverts were about the same color as the rump, but the central rectrices appeared to be slightly darker, albeit with at least some green iridescence.  The outer several pairs of rectrices appeared to be uniformly black from above, but it was also a bit difficult to see the spread tail clearly.  I was never quite sure about the color of the lores, the supraloral region, or the superciliary region, all of which appeared to be quite dark.  I did notice in the field, a small, white spot behind each eye and also that the lower part of the face, from the chin across the submoustachial region, were uniformly black in color.  The gorget often appeared black when seen in less than ideal light, and it was squared off at the corners without the flared “wings” that are typical of Anna’s and especially Costa’s Hummingbirds.  When the light hit the throat just right it glowed with a fire-red color that was both a bit different from the bright pink of the Anna’s Hummingbirds and with the red contrasting sharply with the black of the chin and upper part of the throat.  The lower edge of the gorget was sharply demarcated along a line that extended straight across the demarcation between the throat and upper breast, below which was a broad, and strikingly white collar that extended across the breast and sides.  The flanks were rather broadly about the same shade of forest-green as the upperparts, but the center of the lower breast and belly appeared to be narrowly whitish.  I further noted that the lower part of the belly and the undertail coverts had a somewhat dingy and diffusely mottled appearance, but the underside of the tail appeared to be uniformly dark. The bill was black, the eyes were dark enough as to appear black in the field, and what I could see of the legs and feet when the bird was hovering at the feeder appeared to be at least blackish if not truly black. My impression was that this bird was rather quiet, in that I heard it give only two or three times soft “tschew” calls that were similar to those of Black-chinned Hummingbird (A. alexandri).",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.00,4,,1114,1624

Instantly it caught my attention as unusual.  Field marks are as follows: Its back and crown were a striking emerald green, not the buff-green you see in an ANHU. Additionally, it was rocking some seriously dark and contrasty “mascara” (auriculars) creating a dark masked appearance (likely indicates juvenile male bird). It also had a blazing white throat, collar, and breast with hints of warm buff restricted to the flanks. Described by EM as “layered, like a beautiful sponge cake.” Its bill was short and straight. Its tail, which was held slightly fanned and motionless, had large, copious white spots. An absolutely gorgeous tail shot was acquired by EM (see the seventh photo attached below) showing a perfectly rounded r5 feather! Its tail extended well beyond its wings (see digibins and Oscars photos (https://ebird.org/checklist/S118363194)). Additionally, Oscar got a nice shot the wings showing very sharp p1-p6 feathers. Its gorget area had subtle but beautiful feathers in small lines vertically, recalling an HY bird. One or two dark regions in the gorget were also noted at some angles but never caught the light (also supports HY male theory?).  Black-chinned Hummingbird is the obvious look-a-like species: Primarily eliminated by rounded r5 feather (7th photo below). And small and very sharp p1-p6 feathers (Oscar's clutch ID pic: https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/482518091).  Secondary ID marks are as follows: This bird had a very unusual and difficult to describe bright green crown, very different from the dusky and dull green crown of a BCHU. This bird's dark auriculars are too dark for a female/immature BCHU. Tail projection was significantly longer than wing tips.  Tertiary field marks: The bird in question had a short bill, but since there is overlap between species it’s not a good identification mark. Additionally, the bird’s wings were slim and razor-like with a relatively dark color. That being said, the light was changing constantly and that should also not be considered a field mark.   This bird had a habit of hunkering down low in the flowers and then spontaneously flying away minutes later. A few times it was chased by the other abundant ANHU. It displayed aggression towards them and even fanned its tail.  Only vocalized once throughout my whole stay, it was in response to the RUHU. Four or five classic ""chimp"" calls and one faint chase call. See poor audio recording below.  This bird was located in the large Pink Valerian flower patch on the northside of the hill. Exact location here: (37.744127, -122.414295).   Accepted by CBRC (2022-053).  A truly miraculous find!!! A 7th county record and a 1st city. My 5th species of hummingbird for the hill (not including Anna's Hummingbird x Selasphorus sp.) and the #150 species for the hotspot.",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,3.83,6,,2011,3017

The narrower inner primaries and wider outer primaries help distinguish it from the very similar Anna's Hummingbird.  ID analysis from Alvaro Jaramillo It’s a Ruby-throated Hummingbird. Apart from the very pale underparts including a white breast band it lacks the densely spotted throat and grayish underparts of Anna’s, it also looks small and slim based on the fake flower size. But key is the primary structure that you can see on that last photo. The inner primaries are narrower, the outers much wider and almost paddle like. This increasing width of primaries is only seen on Archilochus, and the green back and overall tone is good for Ruby-throated, not Black-chinned.""",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.33,3,,2736,3648

Early on, before all the cameras were aimed at the tree and were clicking all at once, I did hear the soft, husky 'chimp' or 'tsimp' call-note than recalls Black-chinned. Vis-a-vis that species, this hummer was very bright green above, very bright white below without conspicuous buff on flanks; a very contrasting black 'mask' from around eye through lores; a shorter bill; and a tendency to turn its tail up when foraging but not pump its tail tail (e.g., not tail-wagging) but did spread its tail when hovering. This is the second record for Monterey County. The first was in this same Corymbia tree from 9-12 Sep 2019, but at the time that bird was not identified confidently to species.

This is the first time seeing two hummingbirds in the backyard. Both returned to a maple tree near the feeder on two occasions but the second hummingbird remained obscured in the foliage of the dark canopy. However, the adult male continued to return to the feeder and garden flowers and fly back to the  area where the second hummingbird was perched. I feel the second may have been an immature bird but I can not be sure of it. This is 16 days in a row of sighting the hummingbird at the feeder.

I noticed I had drifted into a territory where there was a fairly low hanging nest (about 12 feet above water level). I backed my kayak out and positioned myself at a safe distance from the nest and behind some other vegetation. For about 30 minutes I observed the Hummingbird flying in and out of the nest area with nesting materials. I only ever saw or heard this lone Hummingbird in the area. Here are multiple links showing some of the behavior observed: http://www.haussparrow.com/Photography/Hummingbirds/i-bMKx5Tz/A http://www.haussparrow.com/Photography/Hummingbirds/i-6TxB4HN/A http://www.haussparrow.com/Photography/Hummingbirds/i-368rBGW/A http://www.haussparrow.com/Photography/Hummingbirds/i-2nbQpM8/A http://www.haussparrow.com/Photography/Hummingbirds/i-s3K78mS/A http://www.haussparrow.com/Photography/Hummingbirds/i-VMKfbc7/A http://www.haussparrow.com/Photography/Hummingbirds/i-Vhr4NbJ/A http://www.haussparrow.com/Photography/Hummingbirds/i-tV8wxBT/A http://www.haussparrow.com/Photography/Hummingbirds/i-5NktnJM/A http://www.haussparrow.com/Photography/Hummingbirds/i-v9PWsqk/A http://www.haussparrow.com/Photography/Hummingbirds/i-zkVp4Wt/A",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,5.00,2,Nest,4219,7500

Instantly it caught my attention as unusual.  Field marks are as follows: Its back and crown were a striking emerald green, not the buff-green you see in an ANHU. Additionally, it was rocking some seriously dark and contrasty “mascara” (auriculars) creating a dark masked appearance (likely indicates juvenile male bird). It also had a blazing white throat, collar, and breast with hints of warm buff restricted to the flanks. Described by EM as “layered, like a beautiful sponge cake.” Its bill was short and straight. Its tail, which was held slightly fanned and motionless, had large, copious white spots. An absolutely gorgeous tail shot was acquired by EM (see the seventh photo attached below) showing a perfectly rounded r5 feather! Its tail extended well beyond its wings (see digibins and Oscars photos (https://ebird.org/checklist/S118363194)). Additionally, Oscar got a nice shot the wings showing very sharp p1-p6 feathers. Its gorget area had subtle but beautiful feathers in small lines vertically, recalling an HY bird. One or two dark regions in the gorget were also noted at some angles but never caught the light (also supports HY male theory?).  Black-chinned Hummingbird is the obvious look-a-like species: Primarily eliminated by rounded r5 feather (7th photo below). And small and very sharp p1-p6 feathers (Oscar's clutch ID pic: https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/482518091).  Secondary ID marks are as follows: This bird had a very unusual and difficult to describe bright green crown, very different from the dusky and dull green crown of a BCHU. This bird's dark auriculars are too dark for a female/immature BCHU. Tail projection was significantly longer than wing tips.  Tertiary field marks: The bird in question had a short bill, but since there is overlap between species it’s not a good identification mark. Additionally, the bird’s wings were slim and razor-like with a relatively dark color. That being said, the light was changing constantly and that should also not be considered a field mark.   This bird had a habit of hunkering down low in the flowers and then spontaneously flying away minutes later. A few times it was chased by the other abundant ANHU. It displayed aggression towards them and even fanned its tail.  Only vocalized once throughout my whole stay, it was in response to the RUHU. Four or five classic ""chimp"" calls and one faint chase call. See poor audio recording below.  This bird was located in the large Pink Valerian flower patch on the northside of the hill. Exact location here: (37.744127, -122.414295).   Accepted by CBRC (2022-053).  A truly miraculous find!!! A 7th county record and a 1st city. My 5th species of hummingbird for the hill (not including Anna's Hummingbird x Selasphorus sp.) and the #150 species for the hotspot.",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,3.75,4,,2438,3657

Full details to cbrc. Pending acceptance would represent the first record for Mendocino county. Feeding on nosturtiums and alders here: (39.1278001, -123.7157375). Observed from ~8:10-10:12 with approximately half that time the bird was in view, and then again just before 11 as I was passing back upslope. Description: Small, slender hummer in between size of seladphorus and annas. Electric green back, extending from tail all the way to the crown, without any discernible difference between the color of the crown and the color of the back. The underparts contrasted sharply with the bright, pearly whitish underparts, distinctly whiter than the adjancent annas in the same patch. The bird had a pronounced and prominent “mask”. Bold white crescent behind eye. Flanks washed dull green. The throat was overall very clean whitish, with dark spangling up and down the whole length. On a couple of occasions the bird tilted in such a way that a single red gorget feather was visible, though I only saw this three times: once thru bins, and twice in the scope. I was able to photograph the outermost primary to confirm it was narrow-tipped and not blunt-tipped as it would be on a black-chin. The bird called perhaps a dozen times, all typical liquid Archilochus calls, solidly similar to selas and indistinguishable from black-chin to my ear, and totally different from annas. I was unable to get recodings of the call, as it would give it once then stop for minutes",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.00,3,,812,819

Vis-a-vis that species, this hummer was very bright green above, very bright white below without conspicuous buff on flanks; a very contrasting black 'mask' from around eye through lores; a shorter bill; and a tendency to turn its tail up when foraging but not pump its tail tail (e.g., not tail-wagging) but did spread its tail when hovering. This is the second record for Monterey County. The first was in this same Corymbia tree from 9-12 Sep 2019, but at the time that bird was not identified confidently to species. Sheri Williamson identified that 2019 bird from photos some months later.",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.00,3,"",914,1261

Marantz on 10 November 2017 at Lake Tamarisk, Desert Center, Riverside County, California.","This was a notably small bird with a posture that was typical of a hummingbird.  The bill was long, slim, and tubular.  I further noted that the bill was very slightly decurved and just barely longer than the head was wide.  The forehead was sloping and the crown was gently rounded on a head that was unremarkable in size for a hummingbird.  The neck was short and inconspicuous, yet seemingly slimmer than that of an Anna’s Hummingbird.  I also thought this bird was a little slimmer and seemingly smaller than an Anna’s Hummingbird, but I never clearly saw the two species in direct comparison.  The wings were long and sickle-like with the primaries extending well beyond the secondaries in the closed wing and the wingtip having a stair-stepped appearance given the graduated primaries, but I failed to note both the primary projection and the placement of the wingtips relative to the tail.  I noted quite clearly that the tail was short and notched at the tip, with the corners tapering to relatively finely pointed tips, but I did not notice the length of the tail relative to field-marks on the body.  The undertail and uppertail coverts were both relatively long, yet both fell short of even the center of the tail.  The legs were short and the feet were quite small.  I really saw nothing on the spread wings of the flying bird that was all that useful apart from the fact that the wings were beating very rapidly, and that they were relatively long and slim. This was a colorful and well-marked bird.  I never clearly saw the forehead, but the crown, nape, and back and side of the neck were an iridescent, forest-green in color that was both relatively dark and seemingly with a blue component to the green.  The back, scapulars, and rump were also about this same shade of green, as apparently were the wing coverts located near the bird’s shoulder.  I thought the uppertail coverts were about the same color as the rump, but the central rectrices appeared to be slightly darker, albeit with at least some green iridescence.  The outer several pairs of rectrices appeared to be uniformly black from above, but it was also a bit difficult to see the spread tail clearly.  I was never quite sure about the color of the lores, the supraloral region, or the superciliary region, all of which appeared to be quite dark.  I did notice in the field, a small, white spot behind each eye and also that the lower part of the face, from the chin across the submoustachial region, were uniformly black in color.  The gorget often appeared black when seen in less than ideal light, and it was squared off at the corners without the flared “wings” that are typical of Anna’s and especially Costa’s Hummingbirds.  When the light hit the throat just right it glowed with a fire-red color that was both a bit different from the bright pink of the Anna’s Hummingbirds and with the red contrasting sharply with the black of the chin and upper part of the throat.  The lower edge of the gorget was sharply demarcated along a line that extended straight across the demarcation between the throat and upper breast, below which was a broad, and strikingly white collar that extended across the breast and sides.  The flanks were rather broadly about the same shade of forest-green as the upperparts, but the center of the lower breast and belly appeared to be narrowly whitish.  I further noted that the lower part of the belly and the undertail coverts had a somewhat dingy and diffusely mottled appearance, but the underside of the tail appeared to be uniformly dark. The bill was black, the eyes were dark enough as to appear black in the field, and what I could see of the legs and feet when the bird was hovering at the feeder appeared to be at least blackish if not truly black. My impression was that this bird was rather quiet, in that I heard it give only two or three times soft “tschew” calls that were similar to those of Black-chinned Hummingbird (A. alexandri).",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.00,3,,1114,1624

Previous work suggest that feeding about 2 gallons (1 part sugar 4 parts water) per day, as Jan Reed has been doing lately, means about 1000 hummingbirds/day are passing through her feeding station. This summer she had a recapture of an individual originally banded in 2014. Oldest they've had is 9 years. She's had more birds this year than last year. Last year she fed 163 pounds of sugar. 2018 was 185 lbs. This year will be higher than last year since she's fed many more pounds of sugar this month than same month last year.

On much that's a half moon crescent. Also back color matches emerald green of rthu for me and bill length not at all impressive. For me, p10 is obviously narrower than p9 and not particularly broad. On obvious bchu p10 is broad and broader, more club shaped than p9. That's somewhat variable and tough for me at times, but here it supports what I see in face pattern.

Aging is critical, but not too hard.""  This female hummingbird Initially flew in at 12:32 PM, and I spent the next 71 minutes watching it, mostly perched in a brownish shrub next to where David Clark found the Tropical/Couch's Kingbird last week (specifically here: 36.906766, -76.199237), or zooming around within 50 feet of this site. The bird was very responsive to BCHU calls, pumping its tail while perched & chattering away (voice recordings attached below), but unless I was prompting it with the calls, it was not pumping its tail. Sunlight was hitting right on the side of the shrub the bird spent most of its time perched on, so most of the images are very washed out, but those showing the bird on the nearby wire (holding up parts of the lighting display for the festival of lights the Garden puts on) are truer to the actual color of the bird.",Archilochus colubris,rthhum,Species,4747,,4.50,2,,3857,6240
