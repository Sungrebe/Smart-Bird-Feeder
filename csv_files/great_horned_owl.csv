Within a few minutes, one of the Coops chased the GHOW all the way across the driving range to the east, where the GHOW eventually chose a tree by the batting cage in which to rest. As if that wasn't enough, the GHOW was then relentlessly harassed by a RTHA. It resettled at least one more time before eventually hunkering down in another tree where it continued to be pestered by crows. I felt so bad for accidentally flushing this bird after seeing it get pestered so relentlessly.

It was seen last night by several people, and demonstrated lots of defensive behavior. It's a bit small for a fledgling, but not unexpected for an early brancher. I've had about three years of bird rehab experience so I biked over in the snow to check on the chick. It had managed to clamber up on a log, which was good, but it acted very lethargic. It barely clacked its bill three times when I came up to it and mostly slumped on the log. Its outer feathers were rather wet from the snow and rain, and it sat hunched up. It was holding a well-chewed pinecone in its claw. Tried to eat it? I usually stay far away from owls, but I came closer than normal to check its activity and health. No pellets were seen near it. I sent photos to a rehabber who said that the chick isn't abnormally young for fledging. Their advice was to wait and see what happens. The Cornell undergrads will be checking on it every day or so. There's at least one coyote in the vicinity, because we found some very fresh and chewed bones with a DOG shock collar tangled in them last Friday. Hopefully the bird will be ok!",Bubo virginianus,grhowl,Species,8811,,4.11,9,,3000,4000

If you park at Morton field complex, walkdown old farm road ( think that's the name, the trail that had the Barred owl roosting in the Sycamore tree). Walk down that road till you get to where the meadow starts. Take a left onto Meadows edge trail. Take the next left onto Woodlands trail, then the right at the fork ( Chartiers floodplains trail?). Walk on trail as it gradually moves down the hill into the lower forested area. Keep walking down and will be in right location if you see some Rusty old poles ( light poles?). When you see the poles make a right, and then the next right onto the next trail. If you follow this trail it should lead you to chartiers creek. You will see what appears to be an island ( not an island though) it will have a little inlet on it's left,  if you look to the center of this ""island"" there is a huge sycamore tree. Look up you should be able to see this cavity clear as day. Sorry about the directions lol but you should be able to spot it pretty easily once you know where to look.

My first Dobbs record. Having said that, Dobbs has incredible habitat to support many more GHOWs. Exceptional find by Tom Warren and many thanks to him for alerting me about this bird. Certainly an odd bird: despite the throngs of large, old, and dense spruce, hemlock, and pine in the vicinity, this bird chose to perch in a short, open pine right next to the trail (amazing for views — it was impossible for me to be within less than 15-20ft of the bird based on its position — but a horrible tree for the owls purpose). Without a doubt the fastest I’ve ever found a GHOW; I just arrived in the area  and instantly found it preening. Likely a female based on size but I’m not entirely sure. Oddly enough in an area of the OCA that I scour intently for owls year-round without success (granted I’ve been looking in the owl-appropriate trees, not the glorified bush this bird was in &#x1f602;). Soon after I arrived, a walker managed to somehow flush this bird which had been passed by people all day. Incredible to watch the bird take off and land about 150ft away in an oak. I watched it at a distance for awhile before finally leaving. Once again, Tom THANK YOU!!",Bubo virginianus,grhowl,Species,8811,,4.75,4,,3055,4583

However, right when I started to turn back I noticed the shape of a large owl perched low on a distant hedgerow. To my surprise, a beautiful Great Horned Owl was tucked-up and sleeping in the sun!

The owl remained still, with its eye closed tight. After a few minutes it did slowly open its eyes, and looked at me and stood up a little taller, but after a minute or two it fell back to sleep and I snuck away.",Bubo virginianus,grhowl,Species,8811,,4.75,4,,1920,2873

Its facial discs are pale grey and its plumage is much paler than the typical Great Horned Owl of southern Ontario. This subspecies was described in 1961 by L.L. Snyder of the Royal Ontario Museum who named the breeding population in northern Ontario as Bubo virginianus scalariventris. The last two photos are of Labrador Great Horned Owl, a dark subspecies of Great Horned Owl, Bubo virginianus heterocnemis, breeds in northern Quebec, Labrador, and Newfoundland and wanders occasionally in winter into Ontario.

If you park at Morton field complex, walkdown old farm road ( think that's the name, the trail that had the Barred owl roosting in the Sycamore tree). Walk down that road till you get to where the meadow starts. Take a left onto Meadows edge trail. Take the next left onto Woodlands trail, then the right at the fork ( Chartiers floodplains trail?). Walk on trail as it gradually moves down the hill into the lower forested area. Keep walking down and will be in right location if you see some Rusty old poles ( light poles?). When you see the poles make a right, and then the next right onto the next trail. If you follow this trail it should lead you to chartiers creek. You will see what appears to be an island ( not an island though) it will have a little inlet on it's left,  if you look to the center of this ""island"" there is a huge sycamore tree. Look up you should be able to see this cavity clear as day. Sorry about the directions lol but you should be able to spot it pretty easily once you know where to look.

If you park at Morton field complex, walkdown old farm road ( think that's the name, the trail that had the Barred owl roosting in the Sycamore tree). Walk down that road till you get to where the meadow starts. Take a left onto Meadows edge trail. Take the next left onto Woodlands trail, then the right at the fork ( Chartiers floodplains trail?). Walk on trail as it gradually moves down the hill into the lower forested area. Keep walking down and will be in right location if you see some Rusty old poles ( light poles?). When you see the poles make a right, and then the next right onto the next trail. If you follow this trail it should lead you to chartiers creek. You will see what appears to be an island ( not an island though) it will have a little inlet on it's left,  if you look to the center of this ""island"" there is a huge sycamore tree. Look up you should be able to see this cavity clear as day. Sorry about the directions lol but you should be able to spot it pretty easily once you know where to look.

Within a few minutes, one of the Coops chased the GHOW all the way across the driving range to the east, where the GHOW eventually chose a tree by the batting cage in which to rest. As if that wasn't enough, the GHOW was then relentlessly harassed by a RTHA. It resettled at least one more time before eventually hunkering down in another tree where it continued to be pestered by crows. I felt so bad for accidentally flushing this bird after seeing it get pestered so relentlessly.

The owl was sitting upright in a deciduous tree about 10' up from the ground. It looked a  little bigger than a Barred owl, but smaller than a GGOW. It had 2 tufts, ""ears"", on top of its head. They were orangey-rusty at the base, black in front. The owl had yellow eyes, a round face, wide white rings around its eyes, rusty patches on the upper outer edges of the eyes, a black ring around the face disc, and a thin white V from the tufts to the dark gray hooked bill. Under the chin it had a white patch that appeared to be in a V shape, like bib. Its ""moustaches"" were white and grey speckled.  There was fine brown wavy barring on a white chest and belly, browns and gray with white speckles on wings and back. It had white  under the tail. There are brown bands on the tail and the terminal band was white. The pattern on the head made it look like tightly curled wool. Overall the bird looked (a slightly grayish) brown with white markings. I only got a brief glimpse of one foot when the bird changed position. It appeared to have white feathers down to the toes with black claws. It was not like the 2 larger owls have seen in the wild. A Barred owl has dark eyes, no tufts, a yellow bill and vertical bars. A Great Gray has a white ""moustache"", an all white face disc, no tufts and a different brown, besides being bigger.",Bubo virginianus,grhowl,Species,8811,,4.25,4,,3071,2306

My first Dobbs record. Having said that, Dobbs has incredible habitat to support many more GHOWs. Exceptional find by Tom Warren and many thanks to him for alerting me about this bird. Certainly an odd bird: despite the throngs of large, old, and dense spruce, hemlock, and pine in the vicinity, this bird chose to perch in a short, open pine right next to the trail (amazing for views — it was impossible for me to be within less than 15-20ft of the bird based on its position — but a horrible tree for the owls purpose). Without a doubt the fastest I’ve ever found a GHOW; I just arrived in the area  and instantly found it preening. Likely a female based on size but I’m not entirely sure. Oddly enough in an area of the OCA that I scour intently for owls year-round without success (granted I’ve been looking in the owl-appropriate trees, not the glorified bush this bird was in &#x1f602;). Soon after I arrived, a walker managed to somehow flush this bird which had been passed by people all day. Incredible to watch the bird take off and land about 150ft away in an oak. I watched it at a distance for awhile before finally leaving. Once again, Tom THANK YOU!!",Bubo virginianus,grhowl,Species,8811,,4.33,3,,3097,4646

Its facial discs are pale grey and its plumage is much paler than the typical Great Horned Owl of southern Ontario. This subspecies was described in 1961 by L.L. Snyder of the Royal Ontario Museum who named the breeding population in northern Ontario as Bubo virginianus scalariventris.

However, right when I started to turn back I noticed the shape of a large owl perched low on a distant hedgerow. To my surprise, a beautiful Great Horned Owl was tucked-up and sleeping in the sun! I slowly made my way closer, constantly checking that the owl was still asleep. Once I was within 100 feet, I crawled over closer and tried to stay hidden in the grass. The owl remained still, with its eye closed tight. After a few minutes it did slowly open its eyes, and looked at me and stood up a little taller, but after a minute or two it fell back to sleep and I snuck away.",Bubo virginianus,grhowl,Species,8811,,4.33,3,,1756,2631

The owl flew over a hundred yards and then across the road. The juvenile from this year was perched nearby in the open.   Very cooperative and didn't react to all the photographers standing around.  I think there is a chance the juvenile may stay into at least early October.  I am not as familiar with the dispersal pattern of this species but have read that they tend to disperse from the natal area in the fall.  On the otherhand, I know way too much about the eastern screech owl :-)",Bubo virginianus,grhowl,Species,8811,,5.00,2,,800,682

I spotted this bird on the ground in Greenridge Cemetery which didn't seem right.  I didn't want to approach too closely so circled around.  It stayed in the same spot only moving its head.  I continued my walk but passed through a while later on my way home.  I thought it was gone and went to the spot only to find I was almost on top of it.  It had moved a couple feet under a bush.  Ironically it was by several of my ancestor's graves...haha.  I called Fellow Mortals and they called me back mid day and told me how I could capture and box it.    When I went back to the cemetery it was not in that spot but some cemetery workers had seen it and directed me to it.  It had moved maybe 50 yards.  I managed to capture it and get it in a box...still can hardly believe it...and then I took it out to Fellow Mortals.  They evaluated it with some neurological symptoms but generally good health otherwise.  They marked it as having a fair prognosis.

Merlin suggested that a Barn Owl was also present. I have seen Barn Owls many times at Lk_Yos, but I have yet to hear one make any sound. I didn’t hear anything on my recordings that persuaded me that Barn Owl was real. When I uploaded my two recordings to BirdNET, the program assigned the maximum score of 1.00 to GHO and scores of 0.22 and 0.06 to Barn Owl.

The owlets were inquisitive, looking around at every noise (including me at some points!) and other people walking along the trail and dogs barking in the distance. Mostly groggy when first seen, but upon visiting again at the end of the day (and watching them beyond after I stopped this checklist) they became much more active as night set in.

Was successful at angling slightly away from it and slowly turning for the shot multiple times.  NOTE: This GHO has a damaged eye. It appears to me that it has taken a strike in its left eye that has damaged its yellow iris.
