At 8:30 this morning I heard the now familiar song of the White-eyed Vireo in the dense thicket just off our property. I had not seen or heard it since but we were gone for 3 1/2 days.

I first spotted this bird foraging in the buckthorn that overhangs the northwest corner of the yard. I was inside the house, idly staring out the window (as usual), and almost couldn't believe what I was seeing, but was confident enough to send an alert to the NE Ithaca WhatsApp group. I then shoes on, ran outside and went just inside the woods behind the house, and started intense playback. after several minutes the vireo returned, but I lost it while trying to photograph it with my substandard camera, just before Jay showed up. birds started drifting away from the playback, we moved a little deeper into the woods and started up again. Jay soon relocated it and we both had nice views, before it dropped down into tangles around the small depression that floods after rains and was harder to view (especially from where I was). when last seen seemed to moving farther away (heading farther north). larger and more stolid than a kinglet. upperparts generally olive with pale gray crown, nape, and sides of neck, but prominent yellow lores. two well-defined whitish wingbars. underparts generally dull white, with broad pale yellowish green wash on flanks. new for the yard list, the first addition since May 2021 (a long drought!).",Vireo griseus,whevir,Species,18966,,5.00,4,,2941,4427

I first spotted this bird foraging in the buckthorn that overhangs the northwest corner of the yard. I was inside the house, idly staring out the window (as usual), and almost couldn't believe what I was seeing, but was confident enough to send an alert to the NE Ithaca WhatsApp group. I then shoes on, ran outside and went just inside the woods behind the house, and started intense playback. after several minutes the vireo returned, but I lost it while trying to photograph it with my substandard camera, just before Jay showed up. birds started drifting away from the playback, we moved a little deeper into the woods and started up again. Jay soon relocated it and we both had nice views, before it dropped down into tangles around the small depression that floods after rains and was harder to view (especially from where I was). when last seen seemed to moving farther away (heading farther north). larger and more stolid than a kinglet. upperparts generally olive with pale gray crown, nape, and sides of neck, but prominent yellow lores. two well-defined whitish wingbars. underparts generally dull white, with broad pale yellowish green wash on flanks. new for the yard list, the first addition since May 2021 (a long drought!).",Vireo griseus,whevir,Species,18966,,5.00,3,,3400,4823

Thankfully birds were easy to find and with patience they approached fairly close. Striking white eyes. Quite happy with this encounter and thankful for the birder that posted some WEVI elsewhere on the grounds earlier in the week. Birds were present and active the entirety of the time I was here, in the same general location, likely breeders here. A possible 3rd bird, juvenile, might have been present but I couldn't confirm.

Was walking around Lake 6 hoping for Red-breasted Nuthatches, or even better Red Crossbills, in Lake 6 pines.  Stopped to pish for birds in back corner where Harris's Sparrows were found in past only to have a little yellow passerine fly in. At first thought, cool, an Orange-crowned Warbler....  but quickly realized, it's a White-eyed Vireo.  Went to take photos and realized the battery on my camera was dead.  Tried to get pictures with my phone, but that was useless.  Ran all the way back to my truck, got a new battery and came back and found the bird to obtain below photos.  Notes: - Bird was in good light, flew in close to my pishing.   - Chattering at times. - Head:  Yellow spectacles, gray nape and neck, white throat, could even see white eye well. - Body, yellow flanks, white stomach, dark wing with two white wing bards - Would love this to be something even rarer, but nothing else fits; and this description (much less photos) rule out all expected winter warbler species in Missouri (Pine, Orange-crowned, C. Yellowthroat).",Vireo griseus,whevir,Species,18966,,4.33,3,,2664,1946

Several of us also got the bird and in fact while I was photographing it suddenly a 2ND WEVI popped up and sat in the same tree though just a bit too far apart for me to get them both in one shot. We had thought we were hearing a 2nd WEVI when we were initially watching the 1st one so it was nice to confirm there were indeed 2 of them.  Great birds with yellow ""eye glasses"" and obvious white eye with dark iris. Overall yellow wash at the flanks and high into the breast (the one WEVI had more extensive yellow than the other) and white at the throat. Olive green on the back and obvious white wing bars.

An apparent recent fledgling, but actually looked small enough to be a nestling: the tail was just a stub, maybe just a 1/4 inch long.  Wasn't really sure WHAT at first this small brand-new fledgling actually was, as it perched in the sparse cover of a low shrub on edge of the back patio, giving incessant begging calls. Was glad (and surprised) to see it could fly fairly well, when it went up into a small live oak outside Debbie's office window. The begging calls were short, given once every 1-2 seconds, non-stop.  Did not sound at all like the fairly distinctive call of a new fledgling Least Bells Vireos (a species I worked with for around 30 years in SoCal).  Backed off a bit to watch and see if an adult would come in to feed it, but saw nothing (and while the small fledgling was present didn't even hear any BEVIs or WEVIs singing in the general area).   Definitely a juvenile vireo, and eventually began to feel it was more likely a White-eyed Vireo fledgling based mostly on the sound of the begging calls (the calls were not at all similar to those given by young fledgling BEVIs, at least of the pusillus ssp.).  This fledgling in the backyard exhibited very bold white wingbars (especially on the greater coverts and tertials) and crisp white, to pale yellow, edgings on the secondaries and tertials. There did not appear to be any hint of a pale/palish supercilium, though there did seem to be a faint suggestion (perhaps, but not sure) of spectacles. Underparts were pale, and perhaps just a hint of pale yellowish on the flank/sides.",Vireo griseus,whevir,Species,18966,,5.00,2,,2141,3144

I noticed a handful of Ruby-crowned Kinglets in the side woods, and see one is a bit slower.  With my naked eye, I suspected a White-eyed or even Bell's (!) vireo...I couldn't see the eye well with my naked eye obviously but actually thought it was dark.

Ce qui est dommage dans tout cette histoire, outre le fait que cet individu ne survivra certainement pas s’il ne finit pas par quitter avant les grands froids, c’est le manque de savoir-vivre et de savoir être de certains et certaines photographes. Non seulement ces individus pourchassaient un oiseau actuellement en mode survie, mais s’aventuraient hors sentier, dans la tourbière qui est, rappelons-le, un habitat fragile et sensible au piétinement (vous constaterez l’état du sentier pour vous en convaincre) sans se soucier des observateurs présents et de leur droit eux aussi de pouvoir observer cette rareté. Depuis le début de sa présence à la base de plein air, cet oiseau a toujours pu être observé et photographié depuis la passerelle et le sentier. Les nombreuses photos publiées et prises dans le respect de l’oiseau, des autres et de l’habitat en sont la preuve. Un peu de savoir-vivre et de civisme svp !

Marantz on 27 May 2017 in the Point Loma neighborhoods, San Diego County, California.","We arrived today to find another birder who had heard the continuing vireo a few minutes before we arrived, yet the vireo remained quiet for another half-hour before singing several times and again going quiet at 1:09 pm.  Roughly 45 minutes later, at 1:46 pm, this bird sang again for a couple of minutes before going quiet again for a short period of time, but over the next half-hour the bird sang intermittently and occasionally showed itself as it foraged in the upper levels of the relatively low yet densely vegetated trees.  The song, which I would have transcribed as “chipeta-purweeo-chip” was both relatively loud and distinctive, and in addition to this song, the vireo gave a scold that was essentially a “chur, chur, chur.”  That this bird moved slowly amid dense vegetation made it difficult to see, and the breezy conditions made the search far more challenging than likely would have been the case under calm conditions.  We last saw this bird at 2:15 pm, but I doubt it moved far. This was a relatively small bird yet it was noticeably larger and stockier than an Orange-crowned Warbler that was in the same area, and in both respects, it was probably more like that of a Pacific-Slope Flycatcher that was also seen in the same trees despite its rather different behavior.  I further noted on the vireo a short bill that was both stouter than that of a warbler throughout its length and with a blunt tip.  The forehead and crown were rounded on a head that seemed large in proportion to the body.  The neck was short and stocky, and the body was noticeably plump, but because this bird was always seen overhead, I was unable to determine its posture.  I also failed to notice both the primary projection and the placement of the wingtips relative to the tail, which was of medium-length, slightly flared, and with a jagged and seemingly worn tip.  I saw no details on either the legs or feet. This was a subtly patterned bird, yet for a vireo it was relatively colorful.  Surrounding the eyes were the broad and seemingly diffuse spectacles that combined yellow feathering in the supraloral region and around the eyes.  I cannot recall seeing the forehead clearly, but the crown and auriculars appeared dingy though I was unable to determine if they were more grayish or olive.  I was more confident that the back was olive in color and that the wings were dusky with at least one relatively narrow, yet well-defined, wingbar that was produced by whitish tips to the greater coverts.  The remiges were fringed paler, which resulted in a striped pattern to the rear part of the wing that was generally indistinct yet most conspicuous as a broad, whitish edge to at least one of the innermost secondaries. Contrasting with the darker upperparts, the throat and breast were a cream-colored to dull whitish, but the belly and undertail coverts seemed even dingier, and the flanks were washed with pale yellow from the shoulder along the lower edge of the wing.  The underside of the tail was uniformly dark. The bill was dark gray, seemingly with the cutting edges paler, and the eyes were dull whitish, but I never clearly saw the legs or feet.",Vireo griseus,whevir,Species,18966,,4.00,3,,1431,2116

Great birds with yellow ""eye glasses"" and obvious white eye with dark iris.

Was walking around Lake 6 hoping for Red-breasted Nuthatches, or even better Red Crossbills, in Lake 6 pines.  Stopped to pish for birds in back corner where Harris's Sparrows were found in past only to have a little yellow passerine fly in. At first thought, cool, an Orange-crowned Warbler....  but quickly realized, it's a White-eyed Vireo.  Went to take photos and realized the battery on my camera was dead.  Tried to get pictures with my phone, but that was useless.  Ran all the way back to my truck, got a new battery and came back and found the bird to obtain below photos.  Notes: - Bird was in good light, flew in close to my pishing.   - Chattering at times. - Head:  Yellow spectacles, gray nape and neck, white throat, could even see white eye well. - Body, yellow flanks, white stomach, dark wing with two white wing bards - Would love this to be something even rarer, but nothing else fits; and this description (much less photos) rule out all expected winter warbler species in Missouri (Pine, Orange-crowned, C.

À la première audition, nous croyons qu'il s'agit simplement d'une courte strophe improvisées d'un Moqueur chat, mais le même chant est émis encore et encore à intervalles réguliers. Installés de chaque côté du petit bosquet de conifères d'où provient le chant, nous cherchons durant une dizaine de minutes sans réussir à voir l'oiseau qui ne peut pourtant pas être bien loin! Il change même de place à quelques reprises sans que nous ne réussissions à mettre l'oeil dessus! Nous parvenons finalement à distinguer sa silhouette durant une fraction de secondes et toutes les pièces du casse-tête se mettent en place: un Viréo aux yeux blanc!!! Le viréo est extrêmement actif et ne reste jamais en place plus de trois secondes, même un Roitelet à couronne rubis observé à ses côtés semble presque amorphe en comparaison! Les fréquents coups d'oeil brefs nous permettent tout de même de voir ses couleurs caractéristiques: -sommet de la tête, dos, ailes et queue verts, côtés du cou gris, lunettes jaunes faisant ressortir son iris blanc, barres alaires blanches et flancs jaune-verdâtre très visibles. Quelques photos ont finalement pu être prises et un enregistrement de son chant a été réalisé. Première mention régionale!",Vireo griseus,whevir,Species,18966,,3.67,3,,1365,2048

Several of us also got the bird and in fact while I was photographing it suddenly a 2ND WEVI popped up and sat in the same tree though just a bit too far apart for me to get them both in one shot. We had thought we were hearing a 2nd WEVI when we were initially watching the 1st one so it was nice to confirm there were indeed 2 of them.  Great birds with yellow ""eye glasses"" and obvious white eye with dark iris. Overall yellow wash at the flanks and high into the breast (the one WEVI had more extensive yellow than the other) and white at the throat. Olive green on the back and obvious white wing bars.

I first spotted this bird foraging in the buckthorn that overhangs the northwest corner of the yard. I was inside the house, idly staring out the window (as usual), and almost couldn't believe what I was seeing, but was confident enough to send an alert to the NE Ithaca WhatsApp group. I then shoes on, ran outside and went just inside the woods behind the house, and started intense playback. after several minutes the vireo returned, but I lost it while trying to photograph it with my substandard camera, just before Jay showed up. birds started drifting away from the playback, we moved a little deeper into the woods and started up again. Jay soon relocated it and we both had nice views, before it dropped down into tangles around the small depression that floods after rains and was harder to view (especially from where I was). when last seen seemed to moving farther away (heading farther north). larger and more stolid than a kinglet. upperparts generally olive with pale gray crown, nape, and sides of neck, but prominent yellow lores. two well-defined whitish wingbars. underparts generally dull white, with broad pale yellowish green wash on flanks. new for the yard list, the first addition since May 2021 (a long drought!).",Vireo griseus,whevir,Species,18966,,4.00,2,"",1769,2820

Marantz on 28 June 2023 at Edwards Field, Lone Pine, Inyo County, California.","After driving up this morning in search of a bird that had been found the previous morning by Russell Kokx, I had been present over an hour before I began hearing the continuing vireo singing from just outside the fence at the southwestern corner of the woodlot.  I then followed this bird around for most of the next two hours in the hope of getting reasonable views, photos, and audio recordings, albeit with only limited success.  Although the vireo sang consistently, it also remained within dense vegetation and it moved extensively, which made it difficult to see even though I knew about where it was most of this time.  I never did get more than mediocre views of the bird, generally in bad light and at a distance, but I was able to get a few bad photos and one or two that were reasonably decent.  Moreover, despite the rather loud environment, both as a result of the winds and with military jets flying overhead repeatedly, I should have obtained a few reasonably good recordings of the singing bird.  Alerting me to its presence, was this bird’s distinctive song, which represented the typical “chip, purweeo-chip” or similar variants on this theme, and which it gave repeatedly, though sometimes separated by short periods of silence during which it would regularly move some distance.  I concentrated on getting photos when the bird was at its closest points, which likely contributed to my generally poor views through Zeiss 10 × 42 Victory SF binoculars, so some of my better views were obtained through the viewfinder of a Sony FE 200-600 mm f/5.6-6.3 G OSS zoom lens on a Sony a7RV body.  In fact, I saw the pale eyes only through my viewfinder and never through binoculars, through which I had a hard time seeing any feather detail.  I may also have heard this bird call a few times, but it was difficult to be sure, especially given that I encountered it more than once in loose association with families of House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon), which were abundant around the woodlot.  Over time, I followed the vireo from the southwestern corner of the woodlot north along the west side, and then east along the north side of the property, where I eventually lost track of it.  My impression was that this bird was moving almost constantly, and although it remained relatively low, it appeared to spend most of its time between about eye-level and four or five meters above the ground.  Nevertheless, some of my better views were obtained when it was higher in the trees, where the vegetation was more open, and the bird was five to seven meters above the ground. This was a relatively small, plump passerine that was clearly a bit larger than the wrens that were in the same area.  I never saw it with a warbler, but I suspect it would have been a bit larger and heavier-bodied.  I noted that the bill was short, relatively stout, and with a blunt tip, but I was unable to see the finer details of its length or shape.  The forehead was sloping and the crown was rounded on a head that appeared to be larger relative to the bird’s size than that of a warbler.  I also thought the neck was short and stout, and that the body was plump, full-chested, and larger than that of a warbler.  I was unable to discern in the field any structure details of the wings, but the tail was of medium length, roughly comparable to the body without the head and neck, and with a square to jagged tip.  I also noted that the posture of the body was approximately diagonal when the bird sang, that the bill was pointed somewhat upward, and that the tail was held downward more strongly than the body and shaken when the bird sang.  I saw the legs and feet, but cannot now recall any details about them. My views of the plumage patterns were roughly comparable to those of its structure, but given the often bad light and distance from which my observations were often made, I had a difficult time seeing much detail on a bird that appeared rather worn in appearance.  The head appeared rather dingy, but I was unsure whether it was gray or olive, and even though I saw some yellow around the eyes through my viewfinder at one point, I had a hard time seeing this through binoculars.  I could see that the back was olive to greenish in color, that it lacked internal markings, and that it contrasted with the sooty-brown wings, but even during my best views I saw no obvious wingbars on coverts that appeared to be rather worn.  Even the remiges appeared rather plain, though I thought at least once that the innermost secondaries had paler edges internally.  Nevertheless, the wings generally appeared rather dusky and poorly marked, suggesting to me that they were quite worn.  I thought the tail was also dark, but on it I was unable to see either the previse color or if it was fringed paler.  Although my views were likely better of the underparts than the upperparts, I thought the former appeared generally dingy, but also paler than the upperparts.  I cannot recall noting any yellow below on a bird that appeared to be a dingy, light-gray essentially throughout the underparts.  I saw no obvious markings below, but the overall appearance was uneven, suggesting that the bird was quite worn. I thought the bill was dark, but I did not see it overly well.  I saw the whitish eyes only through my camera viewfinder, but my photos do show a sharp contrast between black pupils and whitish irides.  As noted above, my views of the legs and feet were not very good, and as such, my impression that they were dark may not reflect their true coloration.",Vireo griseus,whevir,Species,18966,,4.00,2,,2150,3431

Walking down a path I was surprised when I hadn't noticed there was a bird basically right in front of me. I caught a glimpse of it flying away. That's when I noticed I probably hadn't seen it because it was still and sitting on a nest. I checked the nest to find 4 eggs. Not familiar with this species I still wasn't sure what it was. The bird jumped to a few trees before calling pretty much nonstop. Another bird started calling and they were going back and forth. I located the bird in the tree to see a White eyed Vireo. I left soon after so the Vireo could go back to its nest.
