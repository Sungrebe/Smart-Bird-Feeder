Super cooperative today! Striking adult.  [Kellen: A continuing individual, reported here intermittently throughout this winter. Today, it flew in and landed in the known apple tree, not long after we had parked. I think it entered and exited this tree at least three different times, but each visit offered fantastic views, and our last sighting, before we departed, went on for some 20 exciting minutes.   We had many excellent opportunities to study this bird at close range. Among its most striking features, I think, was the bright red forehead and crown--no red was present elsewhere on the head (nothing on the throat or nape). The belly was strongly toned in yellow, which I noticed contrasted the white undertail coverts, and a black, spotty crescent was present on the breast, just beneath the throat. The flanks were heavily marked with dark chevrons, and the dark back was barred extensively with white. The face pattern was also intricately patterned in black and white, so much so that I think making a written description for it would be a bit tedious--I'll defer to our many photos for that. I'm very happy that it showed itself so well.]",Sphyrapicus varius,yebsap,Species,11016,,4.53,17,,2592,4608

Super cooperative today! Striking adult.  [Kellen: A continuing individual, reported here intermittently throughout this winter. Today, it flew in and landed in the known apple tree, not long after we had parked. I think it entered and exited this tree at least three different times, but each visit offered fantastic views, and our last sighting, before we departed, went on for some 20 exciting minutes.   We had many excellent opportunities to study this bird at close range. Among its most striking features, I think, was the bright red forehead and crown--no red was present elsewhere on the head (nothing on the throat or nape). The belly was strongly toned in yellow, which I noticed contrasted the white undertail coverts, and a black, spotty crescent was present on the breast, just beneath the throat. The flanks were heavily marked with dark chevrons, and the dark back was barred extensively with white. The face pattern was also intricately patterned in black and white, so much so that I think making a written description for it would be a bit tedious--I'll defer to our many photos for that. I'm very happy that it showed itself so well.]",Sphyrapicus varius,yebsap,Species,11016,,4.50,12,,3456,4608

Super cooperative today! Striking adult.  [Kellen: A continuing individual, reported here intermittently throughout this winter. Today, it flew in and landed in the known apple tree, not long after we had parked. I think it entered and exited this tree at least three different times, but each visit offered fantastic views, and our last sighting, before we departed, went on for some 20 exciting minutes.   We had many excellent opportunities to study this bird at close range. Among its most striking features, I think, was the bright red forehead and crown--no red was present elsewhere on the head (nothing on the throat or nape). The belly was strongly toned in yellow, which I noticed contrasted the white undertail coverts, and a black, spotty crescent was present on the breast, just beneath the throat. The flanks were heavily marked with dark chevrons, and the dark back was barred extensively with white. The face pattern was also intricately patterned in black and white, so much so that I think making a written description for it would be a bit tedious--I'll defer to our many photos for that. I'm very happy that it showed itself so well.]",Sphyrapicus varius,yebsap,Species,11016,,4.25,8,,3456,4093

Appeared just a couple of minutes after I arrived, affording brief but rather close up views as it alighted on the south side Manor House trees just off the street. It soon disappeared, leaving me with the impression that it went east (downslope and behind the Manor House) rather than into the park. Thankfully my patience was rewarded as it returned to repeatedly work a favorite pittosporum, the same location others have noted.  Presumed 1st year sapsucker with a red throat but no red on the slightly yellowish breast; suggestion of just a thin black band separating the throat and breast. Striped black and white head with some red crown feathers but no red on the nape. White wing patches; partially barred back with two broad vertical bands of spots, off-white on the upper two-thirds, white below.

The supercilium and moustachial stripe are perhaps a bit bolder than on what is expected for the Red-naped Sapsucker. On balance there is more white on the face than for the Red-naped. On the back of this bird displays very buffy coloring, more so than for the Red-naped in general, with barring crossing the center line along the spine (more black in the Red-naped).",Sphyrapicus varius,yebsap,Species,11016,,4.25,4,,3000,4000

Red cap, white throat, black upper breast collar, a slight yellow tinge to some areas, and bold white wing patch. Second attempt today (no luck this morning). We three were sitting on the south side of El Secreto facing the stop-sign side and the two sap-well scarred trees with grim determination. We had already searched nearby locations, to no avail. We’d begun joking that it was time that it made its appearance. I looked at my watch and it was 1344. I said “One more minute” (to when CK had first spotted the bird yesterday). Nobody even grinned this time (one of us had been there since sunrise.) But then, within 2 min., it was spotted! Exactly to CK’s timeline, but it was in a different tree. Nothing stirred in or around the sap-well trees except a YRWA minutes earlier. It must have approached from the south, behind us, and it could easily have snuck away again without ever being notice. It was in the small tree immediately opposite the stop sign, the corner other side of El Secrito, about 25 feet away. Silent, rather stealthy. I believe it approached along Rambla de las Flores (after this referred to as ""the main road”). More on that in a second. It pecked and perched briefly in this little tree then flew south (I think retracing its steps) to an adjacent pine (the one with the top chopped off to make room for the powerlines above it) along the main road. There it foraged very briefly, then on south again to the next pine. Silently. Then to the large, tall pine about 45 yards south of the stop sign and directly west of the residence (4747 El Secreto, I believe). From lower down it walked up the main trunk until it reached two patches of sap weeping from the trunk, high up. There it began feeding and I think this must be a usual food source for it. It stayed there for some time, maybe 15 min. We viewed it up there from various angles: south along the main road, directly opposite it from the main road, and even back onto El Secreto again looking south to that pine. After a while it took off, and we followed it over the house and lost it near the tennis court where it vanished, perhaps into a tree back there. (I noticed new sap wells in that first little tree when I reviewed the photos, and it was pecking a new one.)",Sphyrapicus varius,yebsap,Species,11016,,4.33,3,,,

The neck was short and stocky and the body was plump and full-chested.  I thought the wings were relatively long and that the tail was relatively short.  I am not sure I ever saw the legs or feet clearly, but if I did, they were unremarkable.  This was an odd bird with respect to its plumage patterns, in that it had the more boldly striped face of an adult but also the muted patterns of an immature.  Given that I spent much of my time trying to get photographs of this bird, and that I then waited several days to write a description, I must admit that this description is more superficial than otherwise would have been the case.  My photographs should nevertheless clarify many of the points that have become fuzzy in my memory.  Typical of my experience with young female Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers, I saw no obvious red on this bird.  My views of the crown were not exceptional, but I thought it was dusky or brownish as opposed to being clearly red in the center.  More obvious was a bold, whitish supercilium that extended from just above the eye back across the side of the face above the auriculars.  A complementary moustachial-stripe extended from the base of the bill back across the lower part of the face under a mask that appeared solidly blackish between the two white stripes.  I did not notice the finer details of the shape of these stripes or if either of them curved around the rear terminus of the auriculars.  I nevertheless noted that the lower edge of the moustachial stripe was demarcated by a submoustachial or malar stripe that was again blackish, and which served to frame the sides of the unmarked, whitish throat.  I also noted that the nape and the back of the neck below the dark cap were creamy whitish with a somewhat mottled appearance.  I did not see a well-defined band across the breast, but instead, I thought the breast, sides, and flanks were dingy grayish with an uneven or mottled appearance.  I saw the belly only briefly, but I thought it was whitish or possibly pale yellow as opposed to the deeper shade of yellow of an adult bird, and I have no recollection now about seeing the undertail coverts or the underside of the tail.  Typical of a young sapsucker, this bird's upperparts and wings were mostly blackish, but the back and scapulars were clouded with a deep, creamy-yellow to yellowish-buff color that was more diffuse and widespread than the better-defined lines of white clouding that characterize Red-naped Sapsuckers.  I further thought the wings were more solidly black centrally, yet there was a bold blaze of white along the leading edge of the closed wing that I thought was restricted to the outer wing-coverts.  The remiges visible on the distal parts of the wings were barred conspicuously with blackish and whitish, but I am less sure about the exposed primary tips.  I think the upperside of the tail combined both black and white, but I am less sure about the pattern.  I thought the bill was dusky, if not blackish, and that the eyes were dark, but I cannot now recall any more detail about the coloration of either, or really anything about the legs or feet.",Sphyrapicus varius,yebsap,Species,11016,,4.33,3,,1365,1782

The bird was wary and did not allow close approach and flew to the larger trees in the forested part of the park when approached. We saw this bird twice at the southwest end of the pepper trees, but were unsuccessful in obtaining good photographs of it there. Clearly a sapsucker given the nasal call note, white vertical wing mark, and largish bill. The bird's forehead was red and the throat was completely white with a black border and large black chest patch below the throat. The white face with a thick dark line from the bill through the eye and down the neck all fit this species.

Photos show adult male with red forecrown on a black and white head. Facial pattern shows broad white supercillium and throat stripe, rather than narrow. Red throat is framed with a black border. In one area on each side the red penetrates to the edge of the black margin at the lateral edge. This may be atypical, based on Mlodinow 2006, but Rottenbrom S. reportedly observed that significant intrusion of red into the black throat frame may be observed in male Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers. No red feathers on nape, yellow underparts and extensive barring, rather than two lines, on the back, which also has a buffy coloration, especially on upper back, rather than white, are all typical, but not necessarily diagnostic, of a Yellow-bellied. Given the throat markings, curious whether this could be a hybrid Yellow-bellied / Red-naped Sapsucker? See also Mlodinow et al, Birding; Nov / Dec 2006 for an excellent overall Id discussion. Apart from the throat border penetration, every other feature fits solidly with this being a Yellow-bellied Sapsucker.",Sphyrapicus varius,yebsap,Species,11016,,5.00,2,,2021,3031

This immature bird did not strike me as being all that dark on its head (however, my only reference for the darker Red-naped is books and online photos; no actual experience here).  Also, it appeared as if it was beginning to develop a complete black border above what will be the red area of its chin.  I also thought that the extensive off-white barring on its back suggested Yellow-bellied.  Seen in the southeast corner of the park (Gums Camp) near the fence bordering the condominiums.  It moved toward the south fence bordering Camino Real/Sepulveda.  It appeared to eventually continue south beyond the park.

One bird was always working on the nest hole while the other was foraging and drilling in various birch trees. The female YBSA seems to have stopped or significantly decreased drumming, but I did observe the RBSA drumming on two occasions.

This was presumably the same individual that was reported just to the west of where I saw it near the entrance to this site on 30 October by David Vander Pluym, Lauren Harter, and John Yerger.  Unfortunately, this bird was rather uncooperative.  When it was directly above me, the sapsucker remained mostly on the back side of the small branch in the tree, and during my later pursuit it never permitted a close approach as it worked low along the trunks of the smaller trees to the east of where I first spotted it.  I never heard this bird vocalize despite its active behavior.  This was a medium-sized woodpecker with a bill that was slim, sharp-tipped, and about as long as the head was wide.  I thought the forehead was relatively steep and that the crown was rounded on a head that was of unremarkable size.  The neck was short and stout, and the body was plump and full-chested.  I further thought the tail was unremarkable in its length (for a woodpecker) and that the wings were at least relatively long, but I was unable to determine with any precision the length of the primary projection or the tail.  This bird had the bold patterns and relatively bright coloration of a ""stripe-headed"" sapsucker.  The striping on the face seemed somewhat muted relative to what I would have expected from an adult male of this species, yet the pattern was bolder than what I would typically associate with a true juvenile Yellow-bellied in early November.  The crown and throat were both conspicuously red, and both were bordered by black stripes that were relatively broad and unbroken.  A creamy-white supercilium and a complementary moustachial-stripe were separated by a black mask across the auriculars.  As far as I could determine, the red of the throat extended from the base of the lower mandible down through the chin and throat to the junction of the latter with the breast, yet the red was somewhat duller than I would have expected from an adult male.  The black border was not broken at the corners of the throat.  I thought the breast and sides were a dusky-brown color, but there was at least some yellow in the center of the belly.  I am less sure about the pattern and coloration of the flanks.  The rear terminus of red on the cap ended abruptly at a broad, black band that extended across the junction of the crown and nape, below which the nape was a dingy-buff color with no red apparent.  The back and scapulars were black with a suffusion of grayish-buff mottling that did not clearly form two stripes on the back.  Also evident on the mostly black wings was a broad, white blaze along the leading edge and blackish-and-whitish barring on the remiges.  I was less sure about the pattern on the tail, but I thought that it too was blackish and whitish, and probably again with some barring.  The bill and eyes were dark, but I am not sure I ever clearly saw the legs or feet.      <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/cmarantz/8146513599/"" title=""Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (IMG_1285) - Desert Center - 1 Nov 2012 by cmarantz, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8471/8146513599_bcdb17660d_b.jpg"" alt=""Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (IMG_1285) - Desert Center - 1 Nov 2012"" /></a>  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/cmarantz/8146511305/"" title=""Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (IMG_1284) - Desert Center - 1 Nov 2012 by cmarantz, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8196/8146511305_62ff1a72c4_b.jpg"" alt=""Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (IMG_1284) - Desert Center - 1 Nov 2012"" /></a>",Sphyrapicus varius,yebsap,Species,11016,,5.00,2,,1155,1400

Red cap, white throat, black upper breast collar, a slight yellow tinge to some areas, and bold white wing patch. Second attempt today (no luck this morning). We three were sitting on the south side of El Secreto facing the stop-sign side and the two sap-well scarred trees with grim determination. We had already searched nearby locations, to no avail. We’d begun joking that it was time that it made its appearance. I looked at my watch and it was 1344. I said “One more minute” (to when CK had first spotted the bird yesterday). Nobody even grinned this time (one of us had been there since sunrise.) But then, within 2 min., it was spotted! Exactly to CK’s timeline, but it was in a different tree. Nothing stirred in or around the sap-well trees except a YRWA minutes earlier. It must have approached from the south, behind us, and it could easily have snuck away again without ever being notice. It was in the small tree immediately opposite the stop sign, the corner other side of El Secrito, about 25 feet away. Silent, rather stealthy. I believe it approached along Rambla de las Flores (after this referred to as ""the main road”). More on that in a second. It pecked and perched briefly in this little tree then flew south (I think retracing its steps) to an adjacent pine (the one with the top chopped off to make room for the powerlines above it) along the main road. There it foraged very briefly, then on south again to the next pine. Silently. Then to the large, tall pine about 45 yards south of the stop sign and directly west of the residence (4747 El Secreto, I believe). From lower down it walked up the main trunk until it reached two patches of sap weeping from the trunk, high up. There it began feeding and I think this must be a usual food source for it. It stayed there for some time, maybe 15 min. We viewed it up there from various angles: south along the main road, directly opposite it from the main road, and even back onto El Secreto again looking south to that pine. After a while it took off, and we followed it over the house and lost it near the tennis court where it vanished, perhaps into a tree back there. (I noticed new sap wells in that first little tree when I reviewed the photos, and it was pecking a new one.)",Sphyrapicus varius,yebsap,Species,11016,,5.00,2,,,

I was walking the line of pines between the road and the soccer field and saw it fly into one of the pines. It worked the bark there for awhile and I could see a small new line of wells it was making. It then flew back and forth across the road ultimately landing in a dedicuous tree in the line of pines. I watched it for quite awhile while it pecked at a limb then got quiet and rested for awhile.

Today found by Rachel, who alerted Suzi, who then alerted us to where it was actively moving around west of the park (both west and north of the intersection of Cyprus St & Dryfork Rd).  Suzi then found it at least three times, as it flew from place to place.  We were very impressed and grateful for her keen eyes and generous spirit.  Not sure we would have found it without her. -- juvenile sapsucker of the YBSA/RNSA type (this late into the year, the juvenile plumage cinches the fact that it was not a pure RNSA) -- the red forecrown color was coming in speckled and over the entire forecrown at once in the pattern of the YBSA rather than from front to back like a RNSA -- no indication of a red nape -- the black line bordering the red throat appeared to be coming in very thick, in the manner of a YBSA  -- the back stripes are fairly broad and ""gold""-washed, but I'm not going to argue that one -- belly was yellowish as it flew, per Lauri (I did not see that) - As a Yellow-bellied sapsucker, the red throat indicates a male. - My (David's) fifth photo was photoshopped a bit to increase saturation to bring out the colors to compensate for the dull gray light of a heavily overcast day.  That's the one where the bird is looking over its shoulder.  As Mike M. would say, I ""juiced it.""",Sphyrapicus varius,yebsap,Species,11016,,4.50,2,,1899,1341
