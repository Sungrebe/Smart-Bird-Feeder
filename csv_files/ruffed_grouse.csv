The grouse was first found this morning and then relocated this evening along the entrance road about 100m west of the Quarry Trailhead entrance. As I walked along the road towards the group supposedly watching the grouse I was looking in the bushes on both sides of the road, searching for any sign of the grouse. To my great surprise, the Ruffed Grouse was actually sitting on the concrete barrier on the side of the road less than five feet away from the group. As I got out my camera to take some photos the grouse actually walked towards me and got even closer until it was only about two feet away. Many thanks to Melissa Hafting for refinding the bird and then waiting with it until I arrived so I could find it so easily. It seems ridiculous, but Ruffed Grouse has been a bird that I've been looking for for more than five years; I've been all over B.C. and even to Ontario in my search, and I've been as close as hearing them fly away from me only a few metres away on multiple occasions, so to finally see my lifer Ruffed Grouse actually in Vancouver and in such a remarkable manner is really as special as it gets.",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,4.69,16,,2560,3840

Later that day Simone Littledale, Carter Strope and I went bushwacking in search of the bird and were able to find its drumming spot, a partially decayed moss covered log laden with some kind of shelf mushroom. Though we didn't see it drum there as it walked off after we found it, Carter noted a pile of scat at that exact spot which he thought indicated this was a display site rather just a perch. Later in camp when we told the others, Joachim Bertrands had the idea based on his guiding work in Borneo with Bird-of-Paradise lek hides to build a hide so we could view the grouse drumming up-close. That evening Simon, Carter, Joachim, Aiva and I went off and constructed a hide out of sword fern and fir branches, with some very conveniently salvaged netting which just happened to be within 5 feet of the blind spot. We also cleared a small trail leading to the blind of any twigs and sticks which might crack underfoot and give us away.  Day #2 a number of us quietly snuck into place with great anticipation and found the grouse perched on its log. In a very cool turn of events though, while waiting silently, a Pacific Marten came in nearly over our heads and sprinted over to the log, flushing the grouse which seemed at the time (and we later confirmed) to have gotten away unscathed. A few other attempts were made throughout the day to see if the bird returned which it did periodically, and late that evening Carter was able to see it drum before a Goshawk buzzed overhead.  Day #3 some of us had already headed back to Victoria while other (read; nearly all) of us were fighting wicked hangovers and not inclined to go stakeout a blind at the crack of dawn. Fueled by ire, Redbull (sponsor me), and being able to clearly hear the bird drumming from my tent, I went out on my own, going in barefoot so as to make as little noise as possible. The bird was there, the blind was effective, and I think the videos below speak for themself.  Really enjoyed getting to crack the code on Ruffed Grouse with my friends and excited to see if I can't replicate this again in other areas!",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,4.67,12,"",3199,4422

I only stayed to record and photograph the bird for a few minutes as I didn't want to disturb it more than necessary, but it made it very difficult to leave. After I got in the car it went around and underneath the car for a few minutes but eventually went back to the edge of the road to forage. As soon as we started the car and began to move though, it ran directly at the car and started chasing alongside it so we had to stop as to not risk hitting it with one of the tires. I got out and was able to lure the bird towards me and away from the car before running back, hopping in, and driving away.

While catching up on the birds we’ve been seeing, I go to him: “Well there ya go, the grouse is behind your car”.

The grouse was flushed and easily identified. Loud powerful and fast wingbeats with the obvious black tail band. No other bird is the size of a Ruffed Grouse in the area and nothing else looks quite like a grouse around here. Very easily identified. Two photos were taken of the nest. Ruffed Grouse were spotted several times around this date in the vicinity. Also, our woods are as good as it gets for grouse habitat.   On a sad note, around this time a Ruffed Grouse flew into out French door on the back porch and died. Photos were taken of it.   Now in 2015 we have not seen a Ruffed Grouse since 2012. It is really disappointing to see this species disappear from the area as it was a specialty of our woods.",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,4.00,6,"Egg(s); Nest; No bird",2448,3264

I sincerely hope this isn’t the only Ruffed Grouse I see here in my lifetime. Jonathan and I shared the experience with our buds, Kris and Logan Lakins, and coincidentally, three other birders (Mona C., Chris N., and Jeremiah O.). No planned “field trip.”  We spent over 2 hours searching the area for the grouse without luck. We were already on the road when Jeremiah messaged he had it, and then we turned around and rushed back up the path on foot. The lapse in time between calling off the search and heading back to the location was about 20 minutes. The experience was breathtaking — and not for the running/speed-walking!  Description… Brighter rufous coloration on the tail and neck. Thick black subterminal stripe on a long tail. Vertical black barring on its sides with white between. Chestnut eyes with super cool “eyelashes.” Gorgeous bird in general. The most ornately spangle-patterned brown back I’ve ever seen. Looking closely, there were little cream-colored hearts on its back. Black feathers around the long neck feathers that looked like a flattened ruff. Size-wise, it was surprisingly bigger than I thought it would be; bigger than a Bobwhite. It was remarkably camouflaged from a distance. I believe the bird we saw to be a male due to the unbroken black stripe on its long tail.  Behavior… When we saw the Ruffed Grouse, it was walking on the forest floor about 15 feet away from us. It stayed flightless the entire time. It frequently called quietly, making some “pew” calls in twos and threes and single cat-like purrs (whuuuut!). The bird perched on a fallen log to watch us before approaching; it got within two feet of our group while we stood quietly in place at the forested edge. The Brown County Epic, a mountain-biking event, was happening while we were there, so two to three cyclists would occasionally pass by and spook the grouse further back into the woods. We didn’t even need our binoculars. Unbelievable. It played Inspector Jacques Clouseau with us and every now and again would grab and yeet leaves. I’m honestly flabbergasted by the inquisitiveness of this bird.  Habitat… mature forest with mixed hardwoods. I noticed lots of tulip poplars, shagbark hickory, and maples and plenty of debris/bark on the ground and understory. My tree ID is limited, though.  Our observation was from a stationary position. I made brief descriptive notes on my phone in the field and typed up more details later that evening. Our time was spent solely with the grouse, hence the low count for other species. I logged others earlier while searching (https://ebird.org/checklist/S120204215). The grouse experience filled my cup, so to speak, so much so that I didn’t go birding again for days. The rabbit hole of learning more about this species kept me delightfully occupied.  This checklist was hidden from output for a month, honoring the request of the person who relocated the/a previously reported grouse and shared the information confidentially. I didn’t make the rules.",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,5.00,3,,2394,3352

The grouse was first found this morning and then relocated this evening along the entrance road about 100m west of the Quarry Trailhead entrance. As I walked along the road towards the group supposedly watching the grouse I was looking in the bushes on both sides of the road, searching for any sign of the grouse. To my great surprise, the Ruffed Grouse was actually sitting on the concrete barrier on the side of the road less than five feet away from the group. As I got out my camera to take some photos the grouse actually walked towards me and got even closer until it was only about two feet away. Many thanks to Melissa Hafting for refinding the bird and then waiting with it until I arrived so I could find it so easily. It seems ridiculous, but Ruffed Grouse has been a bird that I've been looking for for more than five years; I've been all over B.C. and even to Ontario in my search, and I've been as close as hearing them fly away from me only a few metres away on multiple occasions, so to finally see my lifer Ruffed Grouse actually in Vancouver and in such a remarkable manner is really as special as it gets.",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,3.86,7,,902,1280

I sincerely hope this isn’t the only Ruffed Grouse I see here in my lifetime. Jonathan and I shared the experience with our buds, Kris and Logan Lakins, and coincidentally, three other birders (Mona C., Chris N., and Jeremiah O.). No planned “field trip.”  We spent over 2 hours searching the area for the grouse without luck. We were already on the road when Jeremiah messaged he had it, and then we turned around and rushed back up the path on foot. The lapse in time between calling off the search and heading back to the location was about 20 minutes. The experience was breathtaking — and not for the running/speed-walking!  Description… Brighter rufous coloration on the tail and neck. Thick black subterminal stripe on a long tail. Vertical black barring on its sides with white between. Chestnut eyes with super cool “eyelashes.” Gorgeous bird in general. The most ornately spangle-patterned brown back I’ve ever seen. Looking closely, there were little cream-colored hearts on its back. Black feathers around the long neck feathers that looked like a flattened ruff. Size-wise, it was surprisingly bigger than I thought it would be; bigger than a Bobwhite. It was remarkably camouflaged from a distance. I believe the bird we saw to be a male due to the unbroken black stripe on its long tail.  Behavior… When we saw the Ruffed Grouse, it was walking on the forest floor about 15 feet away from us. It stayed flightless the entire time. It frequently called quietly, making some “pew” calls in twos and threes and single cat-like purrs (whuuuut!). The bird perched on a fallen log to watch us before approaching; it got within two feet of our group while we stood quietly in place at the forested edge. The Brown County Epic, a mountain-biking event, was happening while we were there, so two to three cyclists would occasionally pass by and spook the grouse further back into the woods. We didn’t even need our binoculars. Unbelievable. It played Inspector Jacques Clouseau with us and every now and again would grab and yeet leaves. I’m honestly flabbergasted by the inquisitiveness of this bird.  Habitat… mature forest with mixed hardwoods. I noticed lots of tulip poplars, shagbark hickory, and maples and plenty of debris/bark on the ground and understory. My tree ID is limited, though.  Our observation was from a stationary position. I made brief descriptive notes on my phone in the field and typed up more details later that evening. Our time was spent solely with the grouse, hence the low count for other species. I logged others earlier while searching (https://ebird.org/checklist/S120204215). The grouse experience filled my cup, so to speak, so much so that I didn’t go birding again for days. The rabbit hole of learning more about this species kept me delightfully occupied.  This checklist was hidden from output for a month, honoring the request of the person who relocated the/a previously reported grouse and shared the information confidentially. I didn’t make the rules.",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,4.00,5,,2980,4172

As I got out my camera to take some photos the grouse actually walked towards me and got even closer until it was only about two feet away. Many thanks to Melissa Hafting for refinding the bird and then waiting with it until I arrived so I could find it so easily. It seems ridiculous, but Ruffed Grouse has been a bird that I've been looking for for more than five years; I've been all over B.C. and even to Ontario in my search, and I've been as close as hearing them fly away from me only a few metres away on multiple occasions, so to finally see my lifer Ruffed Grouse actually in Vancouver and in such a remarkable manner is really as special as it gets.",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,4.20,5,,814,1280

Later that day Simone Littledale, Carter Strope and I went bushwacking in search of the bird and were able to find its drumming spot, a partially decayed moss covered log laden with some kind of shelf mushroom. Though we didn't see it drum there as it walked off after we found it, Carter noted a pile of scat at that exact spot which he thought indicated this was a display site rather just a perch. Later in camp when we told the others, Joachim Bertrands had the idea based on his guiding work in Borneo with Bird-of-Paradise lek hides to build a hide so we could view the grouse drumming up-close. That evening Simon, Carter, Joachim, Aiva and I went off and constructed a hide out of sword fern and fir branches, with some very conveniently salvaged netting which just happened to be within 5 feet of the blind spot. We also cleared a small trail leading to the blind of any twigs and sticks which might crack underfoot and give us away.  Day #2 a number of us quietly snuck into place with great anticipation and found the grouse perched on its log. In a very cool turn of events though, while waiting silently, a Pacific Marten came in nearly over our heads and sprinted over to the log, flushing the grouse which seemed at the time (and we later confirmed) to have gotten away unscathed. A few other attempts were made throughout the day to see if the bird returned which it did periodically, and late that evening Carter was able to see it drum before a Goshawk buzzed overhead.  Day #3 some of us had already headed back to Victoria while other (read; nearly all) of us were fighting wicked hangovers and not inclined to go stakeout a blind at the crack of dawn. Fueled by ire, Redbull (sponsor me), and being able to clearly hear the bird drumming from my tent, I went out on my own, going in barefoot so as to make as little noise as possible. The bird was there, the blind was effective, and I think the videos below speak for themself.  Really enjoyed getting to crack the code on Ruffed Grouse with my friends and excited to see if I can't replicate this again in other areas!",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,5.00,2,"",3389,4693

Later that day Simone Littledale, Carter Strope and I went bushwacking in search of the bird and were able to find its drumming spot, a partially decayed moss covered log laden with some kind of shelf mushroom. Though we didn't see it drum there as it walked off after we found it, Carter noted a pile of scat at that exact spot which he thought indicated this was a display site rather just a perch. Later in camp when we told the others, Joachim Bertrands had the idea based on his guiding work in Borneo with Bird-of-Paradise lek hides to build a hide so we could view the grouse drumming up-close. That evening Simon, Carter, Joachim, Aiva and I went off and constructed a hide out of sword fern and fir branches, with some very conveniently salvaged netting which just happened to be within 5 feet of the blind spot. We also cleared a small trail leading to the blind of any twigs and sticks which might crack underfoot and give us away.  Day #2 a number of us quietly snuck into place with great anticipation and found the grouse perched on its log.

Other than going nearer to the road's edge when he was 25' deep in the woods, I didn't approach him, but he approached me. He definitely started following me--at first, feeding quietly through the woods and walking the same way I did, then when I turned around and walked back (to see what he'd do), he turned around and followed me. Once he came out into the road, he definitely followed me--and I had to be very careful when I left, to be sure he was away from my car and back in the woods.

I sincerely hope this isn’t the only Ruffed Grouse I see here in my lifetime. Jonathan and I shared the experience with our buds, Kris and Logan Lakins, and coincidentally, three other birders (Mona C., Chris N., and Jeremiah O.). No planned “field trip.”  We spent over 2 hours searching the area for the grouse without luck. We were already on the road when Jeremiah messaged he had it, and then we turned around and rushed back up the path on foot. The lapse in time between calling off the search and heading back to the location was about 20 minutes. The experience was breathtaking — and not for the running/speed-walking!  Description… Brighter rufous coloration on the tail and neck. Thick black subterminal stripe on a long tail. Vertical black barring on its sides with white between. Chestnut eyes with super cool “eyelashes.” Gorgeous bird in general. The most ornately spangle-patterned brown back I’ve ever seen. Looking closely, there were little cream-colored hearts on its back. Black feathers around the long neck feathers that looked like a flattened ruff. Size-wise, it was surprisingly bigger than I thought it would be; bigger than a Bobwhite. It was remarkably camouflaged from a distance. I believe the bird we saw to be a male due to the unbroken black stripe on its long tail.  Behavior… When we saw the Ruffed Grouse, it was walking on the forest floor about 15 feet away from us. It stayed flightless the entire time. It frequently called quietly, making some “pew” calls in twos and threes and single cat-like purrs (whuuuut!). The bird perched on a fallen log to watch us before approaching; it got within two feet of our group while we stood quietly in place at the forested edge. The Brown County Epic, a mountain-biking event, was happening while we were there, so two to three cyclists would occasionally pass by and spook the grouse further back into the woods. We didn’t even need our binoculars. Unbelievable. It played Inspector Jacques Clouseau with us and every now and again would grab and yeet leaves. I’m honestly flabbergasted by the inquisitiveness of this bird.  Habitat… mature forest with mixed hardwoods. I noticed lots of tulip poplars, shagbark hickory, and maples and plenty of debris/bark on the ground and understory. My tree ID is limited, though.  Our observation was from a stationary position. I made brief descriptive notes on my phone in the field and typed up more details later that evening. Our time was spent solely with the grouse, hence the low count for other species. I logged others earlier while searching (https://ebird.org/checklist/S120204215). The grouse experience filled my cup, so to speak, so much so that I didn’t go birding again for days. The rabbit hole of learning more about this species kept me delightfully occupied.  This checklist was hidden from output for a month, honoring the request of the person who relocated the/a previously reported grouse and shared the information confidentially. I didn’t make the rules.",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,5.00,2,,1080,1440

After I got in the car it went around and underneath the car for a few minutes but eventually went back to the edge of the road to forage. As soon as we started the car and began to move though, it ran directly at the car and started chasing alongside it so we had to stop as to not risk hitting it with one of the tires.

I immediately recognized them as Ruffed Grouse chicks; we had great views of similarly-patterned Spruce Grouse chicks in Nova Scotia, but I knew that species isn't on the Avalon. Regardless, the pair was directly in my path, and I couldn't in that split-second swerve out of the way without endangering clients. The first chick flew up and over the hood, but I struck the second as it tried to lift off. Seeing it laying in the road in my rear view mirror, I pulled over. As I did, an adult with four additional chicks appeared at the margin. They scampered across the road, the adult briefly checking on the presumed-dead chick, and subsequently disappeared onto the adjacent hillside. One of my clients noticed the struck chick was twitching, so I sprinted down the road to check on it. It stood up as I approached, but I was able to scoop it up since it was dazed. It started peeping vigorously, and my brief inspection suggested the wings and legs were intact. Thinking it might survive, I scrambled up the hillside on hands and knees, hoping to catch to catch up with the family. I heard the adult cluck, turned to my left, and saw it standing fifteen feet from me. The chick peeped louder, so I put it on the ground and watched it take a few strides towards the calling adult. I exited at that moment because lingering would have jeopardized the reunion. I felt awful after the strike, but I am optimistic that the chick will survive the ordeal.",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,4.00,3,In-hand,3817,6680

Later that day Simone Littledale, Carter Strope and I went bushwacking in search of the bird and were able to find its drumming spot, a partially decayed moss covered log laden with some kind of shelf mushroom. Though we didn't see it drum there as it walked off after we found it, Carter noted a pile of scat at that exact spot which he thought indicated this was a display site rather just a perch. Later in camp when we told the others, Joachim Bertrands had the idea based on his guiding work in Borneo with Bird-of-Paradise lek hides to build a hide so we could view the grouse drumming up-close. That evening Simon, Carter, Joachim, Aiva and I went off and constructed a hide out of sword fern and fir branches, with some very conveniently salvaged netting which just happened to be within 5 feet of the blind spot. We also cleared a small trail leading to the blind of any twigs and sticks which might crack underfoot and give us away.  Day #2 a number of us quietly snuck into place with great anticipation and found the grouse perched on its log. In a very cool turn of events though, while waiting silently, a Pacific Marten came in nearly over our heads and sprinted over to the log, flushing the grouse which seemed at the time (and we later confirmed) to have gotten away unscathed. A few other attempts were made throughout the day to see if the bird returned which it did periodically, and late that evening Carter was able to see it drum before a Goshawk buzzed overhead.  Day #3 some of us had already headed back to Victoria while other (read; nearly all) of us were fighting wicked hangovers and not inclined to go stakeout a blind at the crack of dawn. Fueled by ire, Redbull (sponsor me), and being able to clearly hear the bird drumming from my tent, I went out on my own, going in barefoot so as to make as little noise as possible.

Though we didn't see it drum there as it walked off after we found it, Carter noted a pile of scat at that exact spot which he thought indicated this was a display site rather just a perch.

Although originally he was about 25' back in the woods (after I'd been looking for probably an hour), the grouse came gradually closer, eventually close enough that I could have touched him. Other than going nearer to the road's edge when he was 25' deep in the woods, I didn't approach him, but he approached me. He definitely started following me--at first, feeding quietly through the woods and walking the same way I did, then when I turned around and walked back (to see what he'd do), he turned around and followed me. Once he came out into the road, he definitely followed me--and I had to be very careful when I left, to be sure he was away from my car and back in the woods.

Two days ago I observed a grouse picking at shoots, green grass and the green leaves of exposed weeds.   Two of these, after a bit of foraging hunkered down under a shrub and puffed themselves up so big against the below-freezing temps that they looked like they would pop. You could hardly see their heads.they were just big blobs of feathers. They reminded me of puffer fish.

I sincerely hope this isn’t the only Ruffed Grouse I see here in my lifetime. Jonathan and I shared the experience with our buds, Kris and Logan Lakins, and coincidentally, three other birders (Mona C., Chris N., and Jeremiah O.). No planned “field trip.”  We spent over 2 hours searching the area for the grouse without luck. We were already on the road when Jeremiah messaged he had it, and then we turned around and rushed back up the path on foot. The lapse in time between calling off the search and heading back to the location was about 20 minutes. The experience was breathtaking — and not for the running/speed-walking!  Description… Brighter rufous coloration on the tail and neck. Thick black subterminal stripe on a long tail. Vertical black barring on its sides with white between. Chestnut eyes with super cool “eyelashes.” Gorgeous bird in general. The most ornately spangle-patterned brown back I’ve ever seen. Looking closely, there were little cream-colored hearts on its back. Black feathers around the long neck feathers that looked like a flattened ruff. Size-wise, it was surprisingly bigger than I thought it would be; bigger than a Bobwhite. It was remarkably camouflaged from a distance. I believe the bird we saw to be a male due to the unbroken black stripe on its long tail.  Behavior… When we saw the Ruffed Grouse, it was walking on the forest floor about 15 feet away from us. It stayed flightless the entire time. It frequently called quietly, making some “pew” calls in twos and threes and single cat-like purrs (whuuuut!). The bird perched on a fallen log to watch us before approaching; it got within two feet of our group while we stood quietly in place at the forested edge. The Brown County Epic, a mountain-biking event, was happening while we were there, so two to three cyclists would occasionally pass by and spook the grouse further back into the woods. We didn’t even need our binoculars. Unbelievable. It played Inspector Jacques Clouseau with us and every now and again would grab and yeet leaves. I’m honestly flabbergasted by the inquisitiveness of this bird.  Habitat… mature forest with mixed hardwoods. I noticed lots of tulip poplars, shagbark hickory, and maples and plenty of debris/bark on the ground and understory. My tree ID is limited, though.  Our observation was from a stationary position. I made brief descriptive notes on my phone in the field and typed up more details later that evening. Our time was spent solely with the grouse, hence the low count for other species. I logged others earlier while searching (https://ebird.org/checklist/S120204215). The grouse experience filled my cup, so to speak, so much so that I didn’t go birding again for days. The rabbit hole of learning more about this species kept me delightfully occupied.  This checklist was hidden from output for a month, honoring the request of the person who relocated the/a previously reported grouse and shared the information confidentially. I didn’t make the rules.",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,3.67,3,,1865,2605

Scrounging around under the shrubs for food like one did the other day. Today, though, everything has a 1-2 inch layer of snow covering it. Two days ago I observed a grouse picking at shoots, green grass and the green leaves of exposed weeds.   Two of these, after a bit of foraging hunkered down under a shrub and puffed themselves up so big against the below-freezing temps that they looked like they would pop. You could hardly see their heads.they were just big blobs of feathers. They reminded me of puffer fish. The third bird continued foraging by flying up into the birch tree and began munching on buds from the birch and the adjacent flowering plum tree.",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,4.00,2,,2329,3500

If I remember correctly the 3rd or 4th bird was sitting down on the side of the road and we pulled right up to it.

Other than going nearer to the road's edge when he was 25' deep in the woods, I didn't approach him, but he approached me. He definitely started following me--at first, feeding quietly through the woods and walking the same way I did, then when I turned around and walked back (to see what he'd do), he turned around and followed me. Once he came out into the road, he definitely followed me--and I had to be very careful when I left, to be sure he was away from my car and back in the woods.

Each time I turned to leave he unleashed an aggressive dual assault, alternating between fiendish foot pecking and shin slam dancing.  Oscar chased me to my car and after I got inside I quickly found I could not safely shut the low sitting Camry car door without making contact with my angry new friend.  He seized this moment to quickly hop onto the rocker panel, then my lap, and then the passenger’s seat!  In fear of possibly getting pecked in the face I immediately exited the car and thankfully Oscar followed me as I high tailed it Roadrunner style down the dirt lane with my feather friend hot on my tail.   Once he was about 75 feet from the car I beat feet back to the Camry and he chased, but I bested him by a good enough margin to safely shut the door behind me this time.  From my rear view mirror I watched Oscar run after my car as I drove off and when the gap between us increased he took flight after the car.  I was thrilled to see as I was passing a bend in the lane that he, flying in a cloud of dust behind me, decided to abandon his pursuit.  This will definitely go down as my most bizarre birding experience!",Bonasa umbellus,rufgro,Species,1251,,4.00,2,,3888,5184
