See photos. First found 07 March by Keith Maley, these shrikes have been declining over much of their range. This is the only one reported in San Francisco this year. Although classified as a songbird, Shrikes are more predator than anything else. They are famous for impaling their prey on thorns or barbed wire, storing food items for later use. The cause of their continued decline remains elusive. They are currently listed as ""near threatened"" throughout their range. Note the black mask extends over the top of the bill, helping to distinguish this species from the similar Northern Shrike.

Nest contains four (4) eggs speckled in brown.,"-- RARE and CONTINUING --  Continuing observation of the Loggerhead Shrikes discovered on June 23, 2013. Nest successfully located in a spruce tree between the shoulder of CR-408 and the chain link fence of the airport. The tree is about 15 feet tall with dense branches near the base. Nest is about four (4) feet above the ground near the trunk of the spruce. Nest is well camouflaged and hidden, a bowl-shaped nest with a tight cup in the center and loose material on the exterior, creating a shaggy appearance. Four eggs were observed within the nest, the eggs were small (about one (1) inch in length) and speckled with brown (see photo).  One additional adult Loggerhead was observed, totaling two adult birds. These two individuals are presumably a mated pair, given the presence of a nest. The two adults maintain a presence near the nest, perching on the nearby fence (most often), on the tops of small trees (less often), as well as on snags in the field where they seem to be hunting for prey. While perched the adults exhibit a bobbing tail motion, flicking their tails up and down every few seconds. The field adjacent to the nest site has been plowed and planted, and is quite large in size. Surrounding the field is a forest edge habitat, with mixed hardwoods (primarily beech and maple) along most of its perimeter, with red pine and low scrub around the rest.   When approached, the parent birds emit a grating alarm call while splaying their tail feathers. Often this takes place from the chain-link fence or from atop the spruce tree containing the nest. No other vocalizations have been observed.",Lanius ludovicianus,logshr,Species,20860,,4.00,4,No bird,3278,4370

Location description: seen along Ninetown Road(38.9627729, -75.8952830), predominantly moving between woods line, two brush piles, and fence line here (38.9632792, -75.8950014). Seemingly easy and safe to pull off despite the road being busier than you’d expect. Make sure to approach Ninetown from Cow Barn Road—the other direction is functionally private.

The cause of their continued decline remains elusive. They are currently listed as ""near threatened"" throughout their range.

I believe it took the dragonfly off to cache, as this was the only time it left the wire and flew deep into the shrubs. It also hacked up a pellet then preened. It occasionally crossed the road at bumper height, or landed on this busy road to pick up small insects. NOTE: We stood on the south side of the road in one spot. The shrike worked a section covering 4-6 utility poles, flying up the road then feeding his way back down the road. With patience it comes close for decent photos.

Scott and I almost went to Bayside first, but opted to go here instead since the line to get into the National side was so long yesterday. Scott walked out to the beach while I worked the trailside scrub for passerines. As I approached the end of Shell Rd, just before the turnoff to the blind, I saw a largish songbird perched on top of a dead tree straight ahead. Shrike!  I immediately called Scott and told him to come back, then sent a notification to the rare bird alerts. I snapped a few photos before my camera battery died (so frustrating!), then sat in the sand and watched the bird. As soon as I sat down, it flew closer to me - I think one of the trees closer to the path was its preferred perch, and it was waiting for me to move or leave before returning. Scott came back to see it, and Wayne Klockner was in the area and also got to see it.  The shrike worked the immediate area at the end of Shell Rd for the duration of my stay, changing perches every few minutes. It dropped below treeline level once (onto a fallen tree), otherwise it entirely used the taller dead trees in the area. On one occasion, it flew up 10-15 ft above its perch and almost hovered kestrel-style before dropping back down. I never saw it catch anything, but it occasionally spent a few minutes out of view on the ground, so maybe it nabbed a grasshopper or something. It didn't vocalize. I didn't see any interactions with other birds, though the nearby Red-winged Blackbird and Blue Grosbeak seemed to be monitoring it.  What an awesome bird. No idea why it's here, but my best guess is that it's an early dispersal from the Ontario population heading south. I didn't see any bands so I can't confirm/deny that theory. It showed a bit of plumage wear but otherwise looked like a normal, healthy, sleek adult bird.",Lanius ludovicianus,logshr,Species,20860,,4.00,3,,3075,4100

A quick inspection of the nest yielded photos of the young. The nestlings are still covered in fuzzy gray feathers, and their eyes are open. A black mask is visible around their eyes and lores. I estimate that the young are about 8-12 days old. The observation of the nest was brisk as the adults nearby were aware of my presence and warned me with grating alarm calls.   -- UPDATE -- As of August, 2013  Observations of the Loggerhead Shrikes were not made for a couple of weeks after this observation on July 25, 2013. When I returned in mid-August, an adult Shrike was present. When approached, it maintained a close association with a short pine tree farther to the east down CR-408 from the nest site. I did not see the young, presumably fledged birds, but I assume that due to the known behavior of parent Loggerhead Shrikes to continue feeding their young for several weeks after fledging, the young were within the tree.  Based on the observation of the nest with eggs on June 27 and the partially grown chicks on July 21-25, I can make a rough estimate that the eggs were laid in late June (25-27). The estimates are based on an incubation period of 15-17 days and a nestling period of 16-21 days. I estimate that the eggs hatched in early to mid-July (11-16). The young probably fledged in late July to early August (Jul. 30-Aug. 6). These approximates coincide with the observation of the eggs, hatched young, and finally, the probable fledglings with the adult observed later in August.  A full report of these Loggerhead Shrikes was submitted to the MBRC on July 23, 2013.",Lanius ludovicianus,logshr,Species,20860,,4.00,3,,3245,4327

Where to even start? First, I’ll start by thanking Jeff Effinger and crew for finding the bird yesterday. I’ll also thank John Hubbell for confirming it was still present today, then Maren and Dan for getting us back on it after it disappeared.   This bird was extremely active and perched stupidly close to us at times. At one point it landed in the road about 20 feet away from some of us. It was probably the most active shrike I’ve ever seen, constantly sallying down to the ground,  and usually being successful in catching something. We watched it devour several large insects. It coughed up a pellet halfway through eating one of the insects. It also tried to impale a giant caterpillar but gave up after ten minutes of struggling and ate it. It regularly flew to the tree closest to us after several hunting attempts rather than flying farther away. It chased a Song Sparrow but didn’t catch it. It had an aggressive encounter with a mockingbird, causing three other mockingbirds that I didn’t know were even there to start giving alarm calls. The grand finale was when it impaled a Five-lined Skink a few minutes before I left.   Also it’s banded? Can’t wait to learn its history. Great to see it in Caroline County after recently coming through old Maryland Birdlife issues from when this species used to be common here before disappearing completely.  Banding update: This bird was captive-bred as part of the Smithsonian's Loggerhead Shrike program in Front Royal, VA.

Update Sep 9/21 per Dan Pay who got a partial band number off the leg band:  “Further to the Loggerhead Shrike found in Port Weller... I have been contacted by Eastern Loggerhead Shrike Recovery program out of Wildlife Preservation Canada. They are happy to find out this Shrike is from the program. Raised by the Smithsonian Conservation Institute, this bird was released on August 18th in Carden.  ID by my photos the band number was 1252-22463. The pink on his chest was the left over purple markings used during release. Staff at the program were delighted to find out he was eating good, and doing well with the migration.

Found while walking the open area with scattered bushes immediately to the south of the Gay’s Head traffic circle and Aquinnah Cultural Center. The bird was moving all about this area hunting from different shrubs. First seen at around 9:25 AM. It was chased off by a pair of Robins at around 10:20 AM, but may have stuck in the area. Shrike with short stout bill and broad black mask. Photos. The 23rd had SSW winds, strengthening as the day progress to a steady 20mph. The strong winds continued through the night shifting to mostly westerly by midnight. I covered this location well in the previous three days, so likely a recent arrival, at least to this specific location. The photographs are not especially clear, but there appears to be contrast between the tertials (fairly dark black) and some of the primaries (worn and browner). Best seen in the close-up photo of the bird looking away and the close-up profile shot. Pyle’s 1997 Identification Guide to NA Birds notes that Loggerhead Shrikes typically replace some tertials in the pre-formative molt (called first basic in Pyle, 1997). The pre-alternate molt is absent to limited (i.e., no flight feathers). So a contrast like this seems to suggest the bird is a second year (first spring).

The rich gray doesn't show up as well - washed out.

Almost certainly a random one-off visit. Not a whole lot of quality habitat for this species here, and the guess is it was attracted to the bugs unearthed in a small, newly-plowed demo farm plot in an open area next to some small trees. Perhaps the miniature farm-like setting looked familiar to it as well. Unfortunately for the shrike, the feast also attracted many of the local nesting contingent (robins, kingbird, flicker, etc.), which made it clear this visitor was not welcome. Between their constant harassment and the rapidly increasing number of people assembling for a field trip, it soon disappeared.

The cemetery is a small square with dense brush along two edges and some medium-sized trees.  I didn't see any barbed wire fence but there is some black locust w/ thorns.  I didn't get close enough to see if there's any prey embedded on the thorns.  the area is such a small patch of habitat that it shouldn't be approached.  there's almost zero traffic close to the cemetery in the winter so the bird could conceivably try to stick out the winter if not disturbed. photo will be added.",Lanius ludovicianus,logshr,Species,20860,,4.00,2,,1013,1520

Seemed there were single, well-spaced-out, shrikes in all directions from the lake, some near (less than 100 yards) and some fairly distant (as much as a half-mile). Most of these were found by slowly scanning the entire area around the lake by scope.  I haven't seen this many Loggerhead Shrikes--from just one vantage point--in probably several decades.  I recall having at least one, and maybe two, family groups of LOSH at the San Jacinto Wildlife Area (in Lakeview [Riverside Co.], CA), back in the mid-1990s, with a total count easily in the double digits.  That, however, was during a survey of the refuge, which covers several thousand acres. This area around Lewis Lake does include at least one nesting territory, as I saw a family group of shrikes back during mid to late summer.",Lanius ludovicianus,logshr,Species,20860,,4.00,2,,1823,2500
