Originally, found on a CBC on 12/31/2022; first spotted by Joe Melony and reported by Jonathan Heller. I went and saw the bird on January 2, a lifer then. Apparently, the bird continued for a long time, last being seen sometime around the end of March. Now, on 10/23/2023, the bird was spotted at the nearby Washington Boro Park by Stanley C. Stahl, who then recorded it the following day back at the water treatment plant. From what I've observed, the bird has been a lot more hit or miss than it was last winter. Since I was in the area, I decided I'd stop by for a couple minutes to hopefully get a glimpse of the bird flycatching around the hypochlorite tanks as it did last winter.  What I didn't expect was to pull up to the fence, look down at my phone to record my start time, then look back up to see the phoebe bound through the air and land directly in front of my car. Got to watch it very close up for a minute or so, but didn't get pictures because if I'd moved I would've scared it. But how amazing to see this western bird right in front of me in Pennsylvania!  Eventually it flew off but I decided to position myself better and wait for another opportunity for pictures this time. It took almost two hours, the bird mostly flying around the tanks and the roof of the nearby building, and several times frustratingly farther down the fence, but finally it flew back in to the fence where I was waiting and posed gorgeously. So happy to get a picture I'm happy with of this rare species!!",Sayornis saya,saypho,Species,16843,,4.97,122,,,

First spotted flying directly away from my car. I figured the bird was a female bluebird (based on the silvery-gray) and realized it was a phoebe when it perched on a fencepost. Quickly noticed the salmon-pink belly and promptly freaked out. It flew off for a few nerve-wracking minutes, but returned and gave absolutely incredible views.   Medium-sized flycatcher with dark gray head, silvery mantle and wings, salmon belly and undertail, and noticeable solid black tail. More elongated than Eastern Phoebe, and slightly larger (had a few direct comparisons as the two species would sometimes squabble). The bird would perch prominently and sally out after bugs, often flying high into the air to pursuit. It occasionally wagged its tail, but not as frequently as Eastern Phoebe and in a much stiffer, pipit-like way. Sometimes landed in the road after bugs.   Bird mostly preferred the hayfield on the right (if facing the dead end) of the road, perching mostly on the fence but sometimes in the pecan trees. Please note that the road is a state road, so public property, but there are houses and farms nearby. This location has been excellent for rarities, so please stick to the road and avoid annoying the locals!",Sayornis saya,saypho,Species,16843,,4.84,70,,1948,2922

First spotted flying directly away from my car. I figured the bird was a female bluebird (based on the silvery-gray) and realized it was a phoebe when it perched on a fencepost. Quickly noticed the salmon-pink belly and promptly freaked out. It flew off for a few nerve-wracking minutes, but returned and gave absolutely incredible views.   Medium-sized flycatcher with dark gray head, silvery mantle and wings, salmon belly and undertail, and noticeable solid black tail. More elongated than Eastern Phoebe, and slightly larger (had a few direct comparisons as the two species would sometimes squabble). The bird would perch prominently and sally out after bugs, often flying high into the air to pursuit. It occasionally wagged its tail, but not as frequently as Eastern Phoebe and in a much stiffer, pipit-like way. Sometimes landed in the road after bugs.   Bird mostly preferred the hayfield on the right (if facing the dead end) of the road, perching mostly on the fence but sometimes in the pecan trees. Please note that the road is a state road, so public property, but there are houses and farms nearby.

First spotted flying directly away from my car. I figured the bird was a female bluebird (based on the silvery-gray) and realized it was a phoebe when it perched on a fencepost. Quickly noticed the salmon-pink belly and promptly freaked out. It flew off for a few nerve-wracking minutes, but returned and gave absolutely incredible views.   Medium-sized flycatcher with dark gray head, silvery mantle and wings, salmon belly and undertail, and noticeable solid black tail. More elongated than Eastern Phoebe, and slightly larger (had a few direct comparisons as the two species would sometimes squabble). The bird would perch prominently and sally out after bugs, often flying high into the air to pursuit. It occasionally wagged its tail, but not as frequently as Eastern Phoebe and in a much stiffer, pipit-like way. Sometimes landed in the road after bugs.   Bird mostly preferred the hayfield on the right (if facing the dead end) of the road, perching mostly on the fence but sometimes in the pecan trees. Please note that the road is a state road, so public property, but there are houses and farms nearby. This location has been excellent for rarities, so please stick to the road and avoid annoying the locals!",Sayornis saya,saypho,Species,16843,,4.89,9,,1796,2694

First spotted flying directly away from my car. I figured the bird was a female bluebird (based on the silvery-gray) and realized it was a phoebe when it perched on a fencepost. Quickly noticed the salmon-pink belly and promptly freaked out. It flew off for a few nerve-wracking minutes, but returned and gave absolutely incredible views.   Medium-sized flycatcher with dark gray head, silvery mantle and wings, salmon belly and undertail, and noticeable solid black tail. More elongated than Eastern Phoebe, and slightly larger (had a few direct comparisons as the two species would sometimes squabble). The bird would perch prominently and sally out after bugs, often flying high into the air to pursuit. It occasionally wagged its tail, but not as frequently as Eastern Phoebe and in a much stiffer, pipit-like way. Sometimes landed in the road after bugs.   Bird mostly preferred the hayfield on the right (if facing the dead end) of the road, perching mostly on the fence but sometimes in the pecan trees. Please note that the road is a state road, so public property, but there are houses and farms nearby. This location has been excellent for rarities, so please stick to the road and avoid annoying the locals!",Sayornis saya,saypho,Species,16843,,4.88,8,,2085,3127

The facility where this bird is located is not open to the public, so please stay on Perkins Road and do not trespass.

Continuing in the fields along the west side of Shaker Road, favoring the perimeter fences for perching while hunting aerial insects. Often working the temporary(!) electric fence (for sheep) close to the road or the permanent fence corner sticking into the field in the northwest. Did disappear for ~30 minutes during my 2hr observation.   Typical Sayornis structure (longer primaries than EAPH) and behavior but showing pale yellow-salmon underneath (not as rosy as others I've seen). Same pale yellow-pinkish shown on underwing coverts in flight and while preening. Ashy-gray on chest, back, and head except for darker masked appearance. Dark black tail obvious at a distance and when flared in flight; often gave it a thicker-tailed looked when perched. All bare parts dark.   Apparently the 16th record for Maine - only four [recent] records have been reviewed by ME-BRC so far. Vickery lists ""at least 14 documented records, all but one coastal, and eight coming from Monhegan Island and adjoining Manana Island"" but omits a 9th Monhegan record from 14-21 Sep 1992 (AB v47: 66).

(I also saw it between 11:15 and 12:15, but less reliably.)  I had read only a few of the recent postings about it, and I wasn't prepared for how widely it ranged.  As I arrived it was pointed out to me (by a friendly birder: thank you!) as it perched at the top of the roof ladder at the back of the building that houses both the State Police and the park's Visitor Center and Headquarters.  The back of the building is where the bird seemed to spend most of its time, either on the lookout for prey, sallying out to catch it, or preening.  It is a very showy or dramatic hunter, spreading its wings wide and tumbling down and swooping up.  Sometimes it returned to its perch after a sally; sometimes it didn't.  It was visible from both the public parking lot side of the building (where the lighting was less than ideal for photography) and the side farther from the lot (where the lighting was better), but it spent more time on the side of the building near the parking lot.  It perched on the corners of chimneys, on a tall pole, on the ladder I've already mentioned, and on a fire escape, as well as on roof ridges, roof edges, and at the apex of dormer windows.  At one point I followed the bird as it rose above the building and headed towards the dam.  It perched at the very top of a tall conifer near the entrance to the dam.  At that point I lost it, but I found it again on a bush in the rain garden (to the left of the path or road from the building to the dam).  It then flew back towards the building. Then I saw it briefly in a tall tree on the reservoir side of the parking lot and on one of the signs advertising the pollinator meadow.  Still later I saw it near the reservoir across the entry road from the parking lot, in an area that bluebirds seem to favor.  It perched on the top of a lamppost and went to the ground.  It also perched on small trees close to the road.  At one point it flew close to the lattice fence between the road and the reservoir (where bluebirds sometimes perched) but didn't land on it, despite acting at several points as if it was about to do so.  I think the bird's lines are longer than an Eastern Phoebe's; it gives a more elegant or stretched out impression.  The bird generally (always?) flirted its tail several times upon landing, sometimes flaring its tail feathers.  In long flights it looked as if it was merely ""flicking"" its wings several times (as opposed to taking deep strokes) between glides.  At one point (captured I believe in one of the photos I've posted) it called: a distinctly two-parted, descending _pee-yeeer_.",Sayornis saya,saypho,Species,16843,,4.33,6,,1040,1848

First spotted flying directly away from my car. I figured the bird was a female bluebird (based on the silvery-gray) and realized it was a phoebe when it perched on a fencepost. Quickly noticed the salmon-pink belly and promptly freaked out. It flew off for a few nerve-wracking minutes, but returned and gave absolutely incredible views.   Medium-sized flycatcher with dark gray head, silvery mantle and wings, salmon belly and undertail, and noticeable solid black tail. More elongated than Eastern Phoebe, and slightly larger (had a few direct comparisons as the two species would sometimes squabble). The bird would perch prominently and sally out after bugs, often flying high into the air to pursuit. It occasionally wagged its tail, but not as frequently as Eastern Phoebe and in a much stiffer, pipit-like way. Sometimes landed in the road after bugs.   Bird mostly preferred the hayfield on the right (if facing the dead end) of the road, perching mostly on the fence but sometimes in the pecan trees. Please note that the road is a state road, so public property, but there are houses and farms nearby. This location has been excellent for rarities, so please stick to the road and avoid annoying the locals!",Sayornis saya,saypho,Species,16843,,4.40,5,,5278,3518

(I also saw it between 11:15 and 12:15, but less reliably.)  I had read only a few of the recent postings about it, and I wasn't prepared for how widely it ranged.  As I arrived it was pointed out to me (by a friendly birder: thank you!) as it perched at the top of the roof ladder at the back of the building that houses both the State Police and the park's Visitor Center and Headquarters.  The back of the building is where the bird seemed to spend most of its time, either on the lookout for prey, sallying out to catch it, or preening.  It is a very showy or dramatic hunter, spreading its wings wide and tumbling down and swooping up.  Sometimes it returned to its perch after a sally; sometimes it didn't.  It was visible from both the public parking lot side of the building (where the lighting was less than ideal for photography) and the side farther from the lot (where the lighting was better), but it spent more time on the side of the building near the parking lot.  It perched on the corners of chimneys, on a tall pole, on the ladder I've already mentioned, and on a fire escape, as well as on roof ridges, roof edges, and at the apex of dormer windows.  At one point I followed the bird as it rose above the building and headed towards the dam.  It perched at the very top of a tall conifer near the entrance to the dam.  At that point I lost it, but I found it again on a bush in the rain garden (to the left of the path or road from the building to the dam).  It then flew back towards the building. Then I saw it briefly in a tall tree on the reservoir side of the parking lot and on one of the signs advertising the pollinator meadow.  Still later I saw it near the reservoir across the entry road from the parking lot, in an area that bluebirds seem to favor.  It perched on the top of a lamppost and went to the ground.  It also perched on small trees close to the road.  At one point it flew close to the lattice fence between the road and the reservoir (where bluebirds sometimes perched) but didn't land on it, despite acting at several points as if it was about to do so.  I think the bird's lines are longer than an Eastern Phoebe's; it gives a more elegant or stretched out impression.  The bird generally (always?) flirted its tail several times upon landing, sometimes flaring its tail feathers.  In long flights it looked as if it was merely ""flicking"" its wings several times (as opposed to taking deep strokes) between glides.  At one point (captured I believe in one of the photos I've posted) it called: a distinctly two-parted, descending _pee-yeeer_.",Sayornis saya,saypho,Species,16843,,4.50,4,,1098,1952

Stayed low on fence most of the time. Calling frequently a plaintive rising then slowly falling quweeeee somewhat similar in tone to Pacific golden plover. 1st cycle bird finished with a partial preformative molt recently. Primary coverts and most secondaries were juvenile feathers and were contrasting brown with new formative feathers.  Primaries appeared new. Two ages of greater coverts apparent contrasting close to center. 4th tertiary possibly old but hard to determine from my photos. Inner 3 replaced.  Retrices hard to age but several appeared worn on the tips suggesting juvenile feathers.  Missing primary on left wing (P3 told from some flight shots from Edwin) leaving noticeable gap. No molt though. Overall a larger grayish bird than EAPH. Smaller petite bill. Crested head and large wide black tail most noticeable in flight. Distinctive tail twitching.

Excitedly, I made the slogging trek across the recently burned landscape to the far NE side to confirm my ID. As I made my way to the bird, I lost sight of it. I continued at a slower pace dejected by the apparently MIA, not yet well-documented find. I arrived at the NE corner to find the bird had relocated back to the western edge where I just come from. I worked my way back in that direction where I obtained the first acceptable doc shots. Shortly thereafter the bird made its way back to the NE corner. Exasperated I contemplated the pros/cons of a return trek to ground zero Say's. I went for it frozen wet toes and all. The chase became frustratingly more uncomfortable as my toes were colder and wind was gusting during this mid-April return to winter. Peter came out to join me with fresh batteries for my camera. We enjoyed closer looks at the NE end before the bird worked its way back to the western edge. It sallied from its stubble perches to the ground where it enjoyed the bounty of insects present on the charred landscape. After making our way back to the western edge others joined us to watch the phoebe continue to feed. We heard the bird departed west toward the quarry shortly after we left the area. Description: flycatcher bobbing tail. Brownish gray upper parts with weak double wing bars. Blended dark area bill through eye, darker than rest of head.

Stayed low on fence most of the time. Calling frequently a plaintive rising then slowly falling quweeeee somewhat similar in tone to Pacific golden plover. 1st cycle bird finished with a partial preformative molt recently. Primary coverts and most secondaries were juvenile feathers and were contrasting brown with new formative feathers.  Primaries appeared new. Two ages of greater coverts apparent contrasting close to center. 4th tertiary possibly old but hard to determine from my photos. Inner 3 replaced.  Retrices hard to age but several appeared worn on the tips suggesting juvenile feathers.  Missing primary on left wing (P3 told from some flight shots from Edwin) leaving noticeable gap. No molt though. Overall a larger grayish bird than EAPH. Smaller petite bill. Crested head and large wide black tail most noticeable in flight. Distinctive tail twitching.

Did disappear for ~30 minutes during my 2hr observation.   Typical Sayornis structure (longer primaries than EAPH) and behavior but showing pale yellow-salmon underneath (not as rosy as others I've seen). Same pale yellow-pinkish shown on underwing coverts in flight and while preening. Ashy-gray on chest, back, and head except for darker masked appearance. Dark black tail obvious at a distance and when flared in flight; often gave it a thicker-tailed looked when perched. All bare parts dark.   Apparently the 16th record for Maine - only four [recent] records have been reviewed by ME-BRC so far. Vickery lists ""at least 14 documented records, all but one coastal, and eight coming from Monhegan Island and adjoining Manana Island"" but omits a 9th Monhegan record from 14-21 Sep 1992 (AB v47: 66).

(I also saw it between 11:15 and 12:15, but less reliably.)  I had read only a few of the recent postings about it, and I wasn't prepared for how widely it ranged.  As I arrived it was pointed out to me (by a friendly birder: thank you!) as it perched at the top of the roof ladder at the back of the building that houses both the State Police and the park's Visitor Center and Headquarters.  The back of the building is where the bird seemed to spend most of its time, either on the lookout for prey, sallying out to catch it, or preening.  It is a very showy or dramatic hunter, spreading its wings wide and tumbling down and swooping up.  Sometimes it returned to its perch after a sally; sometimes it didn't.  It was visible from both the public parking lot side of the building (where the lighting was less than ideal for photography) and the side farther from the lot (where the lighting was better), but it spent more time on the side of the building near the parking lot.  It perched on the corners of chimneys, on a tall pole, on the ladder I've already mentioned, and on a fire escape, as well as on roof ridges, roof edges, and at the apex of dormer windows.  At one point I followed the bird as it rose above the building and headed towards the dam.  It perched at the very top of a tall conifer near the entrance to the dam.  At that point I lost it, but I found it again on a bush in the rain garden (to the left of the path or road from the building to the dam).  It then flew back towards the building. Then I saw it briefly in a tall tree on the reservoir side of the parking lot and on one of the signs advertising the pollinator meadow.  Still later I saw it near the reservoir across the entry road from the parking lot, in an area that bluebirds seem to favor.  It perched on the top of a lamppost and went to the ground.  It also perched on small trees close to the road.  At one point it flew close to the lattice fence between the road and the reservoir (where bluebirds sometimes perched) but didn't land on it, despite acting at several points as if it was about to do so.  I think the bird's lines are longer than an Eastern Phoebe's; it gives a more elegant or stretched out impression.  The bird generally (always?) flirted its tail several times upon landing, sometimes flaring its tail feathers.  In long flights it looked as if it was merely ""flicking"" its wings several times (as opposed to taking deep strokes) between glides.  At one point (captured I believe in one of the photos I've posted) it called: a distinctly two-parted, descending _pee-yeeer_.",Sayornis saya,saypho,Species,16843,,4.00,3,,1634,2013

Sayornis-type flycatcher with gray back and breast and salmon-colored belly. This bird also showed a contrastingly black tail, which we noticed several times as it preened and sallied. We observed that it heavily favored power lines, but it did occasionally put down in the brush along the stream. We also noticed that it had a somewhat large range, moving from the stream, down the power line about a 1/4 mile north of the road, and across the road on the south side (useful to know if the bird isn’t immediately visible). Hopefully this fellow stays put for awhile…it seemed comfortable but did occasionally get harassed by a nearby shrike. My pin for this checklist should be pretty precise for others chasing.

JM submitted a thorough report to the ME-BRC.  This dusky-peachy breasted flycatcher with a long black tail was perched on the side of the Mallory's house for the majority of my visit. They said it was very active in the prior evening and that morning but did very little foraging during this time and actually would close its eyes for a short time (never falling asleep) while watching it from a distance.

It was then refound at Kaufman Sports Complex where it was observed hawking from the tops of chain link fences for several hours; it would fly quite high or for quite long distances before returning to its original perch or landing 20-30 feet farther down the fence. Constantly and energetically bobbing its tail. Occasionally took high flight and landed on a fence far away. It was heard vocalizing sporadically, especially right after I relocated it at the sports complex. At the sports complex it twice perched incidentally in the same area as two Eastern Phoebes, although it did not seem to be directly associating with them. At about 12:50 the three observers present (me, Alec Olivier, and Jeff Knoop) were all very briefly preoccupied and somehow completely lost track of the bird—it vanished and was not seen again from then on."" ""Vocalized several times; call was a clear and rather rich descending whistle lasting less than one second. Sang twice; song was a similarly rich and clear “whip whoEEEeww”, quite fast with the last phrase going from low to high to low in pitch and descending at the end."" ""Even before getting binoculars on it, immediately knew it was a phoebe of some sort by gestalt. Slim flycatcher with medium-length slightly-notched tail, peaked head, and thin bill. Noticeably larger than Eastern Phoebes nearby, and appeared slightly larger than a nearby Eastern Bluebird. Bill dark and fairly short with a narrow but rounded (not at all hooked) tip. Eyes appeared all dark. Legs and feet dark gray. Overall a grayish bird; back, crown, breast, and much of face all medium gray. Auriculars and especially the lores a darker gray; throat distinctly paler gray but not particularly contrasting with the rest of the bird. Wings and tail dark gray. Gray upper breast blended into a wonderful peachy cinnamon color on the rest of the underparts. This color intensified lower down on the underparts and was brightest in the undertail coverts and especially the vent.""",Sayornis saya,saypho,Species,16843,,3.50,6,,2137,2849

Sayornis-type flycatcher with gray back and breast and salmon-colored belly. This bird also showed a contrastingly black tail, which we noticed several times as it preened and sallied. We observed that it heavily favored power lines, but it did occasionally put down in the brush along the stream. We also noticed that it had a somewhat large range, moving from the stream, down the power line about a 1/4 mile north of the road, and across the road on the south side (useful to know if the bird isn’t immediately visible). Hopefully this fellow stays put for awhile…it seemed comfortable but did occasionally get harassed by a nearby shrike. My pin for this checklist should be pretty precise for others chasing.

According to the TOS Handbook of Texas Birds (2nd ed., 2014), Say's Phoebe ""is a common to uncommon resident in the Trans-Pecos and east to the western edge of the Edwards Plateau. Say's Phoebes are rare and local summer residents on the High Plains of the western Panhandle south through the South Plains to the northwestern edge of the Edwards Plateau. They are also rare to very rare migrants and winter visitors through the Rolling Plains and uncommon during these seasons in the South Texas Brush Country. This species is a rare, but regular winter visitor east to the central coast and the Blackland Prairies region from north-central Texas south to Bastrop County. They are casual visitors to the eastern quarter of the state, mostly in fall and winter."" I observed the Say's Phoebe in the photograph at 12:32 pm.
