Two White-throated Swifts were brought to them from a wind farm near Roscoe, Fisher County. Two birds were recovered from the same wind turbine by the same person on consecutive days, Oct 24 and Oct 25, 2023. Each was delivered individually to the zoo on those dates, Oct 24 and 25. The birds were discovered during maintenance. Both appeared to have been roosting in the turbine and had gotten covered with oil or hydraulic fluid. The zoo washed them and began to nurse them back to health. My guess is that the birds found themselves in the area and lacked a suitable place to roost for the night. The turbines probably looked like their only option. Since the two birds are from the same event, I've submitted the same photos and details under both records in eBird.",Aeronautes saxatalis,whtswi,Species,4103,,4.00,3,,3024,4032

Two White-throated Swifts were brought to them from a wind farm near Roscoe, Fisher County. Two birds were recovered from the same wind turbine by the same person on consecutive days, Oct 24 and Oct 25, 2023. Each was delivered individually to the zoo on those dates, Oct 24 and 25. The birds were discovered during maintenance. Both appeared to have been roosting in the turbine and had gotten covered with oil or hydraulic fluid. The zoo washed them and began to nurse them back to health. My guess is that the birds found themselves in the area and lacked a suitable place to roost for the night. The turbines probably looked like their only option.

Hiked to the top of the Enchanted Rock dome and noticed swifts straggling the horizon just to the NW of the highest point. Distinctive swift silhouettes with curved, tapering wings and pointy aerodynamic bodies, rapid stiff wingbeats. Appeared solid black against the cloud ceiling, but when an occasional bird dropped closer below the horizon, the white throat, rump patches and wing edges were very striking. Long, harsh chattering calls faintly audible from the flock over the wind. They never came super close to the rock formation, and they moved up and down in altitude a lot, sometimes chasing each other. I scanned the group for any odd outliers during 30 minutes of viewing as they moved around in the high winds, usually coming up with 22-25. 31 counted in one full scan of of the flock as they were high in the air.

Two White-throated Swifts were brought to them from a wind farm near Roscoe, Fisher County. Two birds were recovered from the same wind turbine by the same person on consecutive days, Oct 24 and Oct 25, 2023. Each was delivered individually to the zoo on those dates, Oct 24 and 25. The birds were discovered during maintenance. Both appeared to have been roosting in the turbine and had gotten covered with oil or hydraulic fluid. The zoo washed them and began to nurse them back to health. My guess is that the birds found themselves in the area and lacked a suitable place to roost for the night. The turbines probably looked like their only option. Since the two birds are from the same event, I've submitted the same photos and details under both records in eBird.",Aeronautes saxatalis,whtswi,Species,4103,,3.33,3,In-hand,3024,4032

Appeared solid black against the cloud ceiling, but when an occasional bird dropped closer below the horizon, the white throat, rump patches and wing edges were very striking. Long, harsh chattering calls faintly audible from the flock over the wind. They never came super close to the rock formation, and they moved up and down in altitude a lot, sometimes chasing each other. I scanned the group for any odd outliers during 30 minutes of viewing as they moved around in the high winds, usually coming up with 22-25. 31 counted in one full scan of of the flock as they were high in the air.

Two White-throated Swifts were brought to them from a wind farm near Roscoe, Fisher County. Two birds were recovered from the same wind turbine by the same person on consecutive days, Oct 24 and Oct 25, 2023. Each was delivered individually to the zoo on those dates, Oct 24 and 25. The birds were discovered during maintenance. Both appeared to have been roosting in the turbine and had gotten covered with oil or hydraulic fluid. The zoo washed them and began to nurse them back to health. My guess is that the birds found themselves in the area and lacked a suitable place to roost for the night. The turbines probably looked like their only option.

Dives were mostly initiated very close to the swift and missed the swift by only feet or inches 4-5 times, this went on for two minutes over the pond while a good-sized group of birders and birding paparazzi watched on in breathless suspense and dread. The Merlin broke off the unsuccessful chase at 13:04 and flew to the west toward the Tennessee River. The White-throated Swift flew off to the east, and didn’t return to Curtain Pole Pond until 14:14. An amazing drama witnessed by the many birders present. Was able to shoot some handheld iPhone max digitally zoomed video only, will add better screen captures of the frames when able to analyze the footage more completely.",Aeronautes saxatalis,whtswi,Species,4103,,3.00,3,,465,520

Dives were mostly initiated very close to the swift and missed the swift by only feet or inches 4-5 times, this went on for two minutes over the pond while a good-sized group of birders and birding paparazzi watched on in breathless suspense and dread. The Merlin broke off the unsuccessful chase at 13:04 and flew to the west toward the Tennessee River. The White-throated Swift flew off to the east, and didn’t return to Curtain Pole Pond until 14:14. An amazing drama witnessed by the many birders present. Was able to shoot some handheld iPhone max digitally zoomed video only, will add better screen captures of the frames when able to analyze the footage more completely.",Aeronautes saxatalis,whtswi,Species,4103,,3.00,3,,382,444

The birds were discovered during maintenance. Both appeared to have been roosting in the turbine and had gotten covered with oil or hydraulic fluid. The zoo washed them and began to nurse them back to health. My guess is that the birds found themselves in the area and lacked a suitable place to roost for the night.

Hiked to the top of the Enchanted Rock dome and noticed swifts straggling the horizon just to the NW of the highest point. Distinctive swift silhouettes with curved, tapering wings and pointy aerodynamic bodies, rapid stiff wingbeats. Appeared solid black against the cloud ceiling, but when an occasional bird dropped closer below the horizon, the white throat, rump patches and wing edges were very striking. Long, harsh chattering calls faintly audible from the flock over the wind. They never came super close to the rock formation, and they moved up and down in altitude a lot, sometimes chasing each other. I scanned the group for any odd outliers during 30 minutes of viewing as they moved around in the high winds, usually coming up with 22-25. 31 counted in one full scan of of the flock as they were high in the air.

Dives were mostly initiated very close to the swift and missed the swift by only feet or inches 4-5 times, this went on for two minutes over the pond while a good-sized group of birders and birding paparazzi watched on in breathless suspense and dread. The Merlin broke off the unsuccessful chase at 13:04 and flew to the west toward the Tennessee River. The White-throated Swift flew off to the east, and didn’t return to Curtain Pole Pond until 14:14. An amazing drama witnessed by the many birders present. Was able to shoot some handheld iPhone max digitally zoomed video only, will add better screen captures of the frames when able to analyze the footage more completely.",Aeronautes saxatalis,whtswi,Species,4103,,2.50,2,,670,1195

Had not seen either for several months. Next day it looked like two black swifts and one chimney swift soaring above the canyon and over the house (chimmey much smaller and flaring their tail frequently, wings wider). Next day with binoculars watching for 15 minutes about 10 black swifts? ( sharp pointed wings but couldn't see any fork in tail, closed- looked straight across ,couldn't see even a small fork as soared rapidly around, looked like no color at all even when about 30-40 ft overhead. Saw 2-3 smaller swift like birds dark, flaring tail intermittently. They looked just like a chimney swift pics. Today I looked out and saw a a large flock of swifts soaring at eye level (+ above and below). Got binoculars and about 15+ of them were clearly white-throated with both the white on chest, chin, and back flanks obvious. Again there were about 3 much smaller swift-like birds flaring their tails like a very wide fan just like in National Geographic Birds.., and their wings a bit wider. Much larger flocks of swifts are normally 300+ feet above the house when I see them but at times they will come down to enjoy the canyons wind just like the crows, ravens (in large flocks of 20-100, and white-tailed hawks).",Aeronautes saxatalis,whtswi,Species,4103,,2.00,2,,443,444

Birds appeared at eye-level, and proceeded to circle/hunt around the building for hours. It was the ""old days,"" so I called the Kansas Rare Bird Hotline and left a message, and got an urgent to call back to try for photos. My officemate, Susan Frantz, retrieved her film camera from down the street and fired away, including a classic shot with the KU Campanile in the background. A convoy of Kansas City birders arrived at around 530pm and the birds were obligingly still around. I even saw one roosting beneath a window ledge overnight and flying out the next morning. Our record was accepted by the KBRC as the ""fourth state record, first record verified with physical evidence. Hypothetical status removed.""

Two White-throated Swifts were brought to them from a wind farm near Roscoe, Fisher County. Two birds were recovered from the same wind turbine by the same person on consecutive days, Oct 24 and Oct 25, 2023. Each was delivered individually to the zoo on those dates, Oct 24 and 25. The birds were discovered during maintenance. Both appeared to have been roosting in the turbine and had gotten covered with oil or hydraulic fluid. The zoo washed them and began to nurse them back to health. My guess is that the birds found themselves in the area and lacked a suitable place to roost for the night.
