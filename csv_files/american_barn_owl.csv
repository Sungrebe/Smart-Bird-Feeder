As the bird was seen the following day, we assume that the bird had been ships-assisted during the night. A search on the ship was done on both days with a negative result. Since the bird was seen souht of 60 degrees south it may count as the first observation of this species in Antarctica, when accounting 60 degrees as the limit for Antarctica. I have banded barn owls in Denmark, and hence recognized  the bird as this species. Recognizing its very widely distributed and occurs in a large number of  subspecies, it fits well with the description of the subsp. tuidara.  Since an unidentified white-rumped swallow was seen flying around the vessel initially, together with the owl, I got the impression, that some atmospheric conditions that had favoured birds spring migration had occured, and for some reason, these two birds had overshot their migratory goal and ended up at sea, being attracked by the presence of the vessel.",Tyto furcata,barowl8,Group,8538,,4.85,55,,,

As the bird was seen the following day, we assume that the bird had been ships-assisted during the night. A search on the ship was done on both days with a negative result. Since the bird was seen souht of 60 degrees south it may count as the first observation of this species in Antarctica, when accounting 60 degrees as the limit for Antarctica. I have banded barn owls in Denmark, and hence recognized  the bird as this species. Recognizing its very widely distributed and occurs in a large number of  subspecies, it fits well with the description of the subsp. tuidara.  Since an unidentified white-rumped swallow was seen flying around the vessel initially, together with the owl, I got the impression, that some atmospheric conditions that had favoured birds spring migration had occured, and for some reason, these two birds had overshot their migratory goal and ended up at sea, being attracked by the presence of the vessel.",Tyto furcata,barowl8,Group,8538,,4.32,22,,1923,3419

As the bird was seen the following day, we assume that the bird had been ships-assisted during the night. A search on the ship was done on both days with a negative result. Since the bird was seen souht of 60 degrees south it may count as the first observation of this species in Antarctica, when accounting 60 degrees as the limit for Antarctica. I have banded barn owls in Denmark, and hence recognized  the bird as this species. Recognizing its very widely distributed and occurs in a large number of  subspecies, it fits well with the description of the subsp. tuidara.  Since an unidentified white-rumped swallow was seen flying around the vessel initially, together with the owl, I got the impression, that some atmospheric conditions that had favoured birds spring migration had occured, and for some reason, these two birds had overshot their migratory goal and ended up at sea, being attracked by the presence of the vessel.",Tyto furcata,barowl8,Group,8538,,4.11,19,,1581,2812

At 8:15 A.M. my friends and I first observed the bird in flight ... an unusually slow wing beat with wings stretching far forward, the tips twisting and cupping to form a scoop to collect precious air. The flight was so slow that I expected the bird to suddenly drop vertically and belly flop to the ground. It flew directly over Lynda Camburn and she excitely identified it as a Barn Owl! Later in the afternoon the owl took roost in a stand of pine trees, allowing us to admire and study it. That is where Jon Dunn took this photo.

The owlets were in their wooden nest box. Our trip leader told us that he expects them to fledge in about two weeks. At one point a young Amish boy raised the nest box lid and the owlets could be heard hissing and clacking. The image of these beautiful owlets all huddled together, looking back at me with their large black eyes from only a couple foot away, will stay with me the rest of my life!

About two-thirds of the way up the tree, there is a large cavity on the road side of the tree, and although  the light and weather conditions were poor, I was able to see the barn owl in the back of the cavity.  This barn owl is distinguished by its white heart-shaped face and lack of ear tufts, and it iclearly appears to be the same owl observed and photographed by the Millers yesterday.  I am listing this bird as part of my Fork School list because my practice has been to use the Fork School hotspot for all sightings east of Fork School road.",Tyto furcata,brnowl,Species,8537,,4.50,2,,1692,2004

When the owl had a chance to escape, it flew down low out of sight, by the mounds at the southeast end of the field. Ten minutes after this, the bird was coursing again. I walked over to the field, only to find it getting dive-bombed by the PEFA again, as it perched on a wire in the north(central) part of the field! When the falcon gave up, the Barn continued coursing even though the sun was rising. I last saw the bird at 7:26AM perched on a telephone pole along the berm, before it flew off. Interestingly, all the gulls and Brant flushed in the cove (misidentification on their part).

The bird flew across the road and was coursing the boulder field. A short while later, it was perched on a wire along the road getting dive-bombed by a Peregrine. When the owl had a chance to escape, it flew down low out of sight, by the mounds at the southeast end of the field. Ten minutes after this, the bird was coursing again. I walked over to the field, only to find it getting dive-bombed by the PEFA again, as it perched on a wire in the north(central) part of the field! When the falcon gave up, the Barn continued coursing even though the sun was rising. I last saw the bird at 7:26AM perched on a telephone pole along the berm, before it flew off. Interestingly, all the gulls and Brant flushed in the cove (misidentification on their part).

He showed me a security video of an overexposed blurry owl landing on the hood of his truck during the night.  I couldn't make a clear ID and he allowed me to look in his barn.  Above the dark hay mow was a cupula which was even more dark.  It seemed like the perfect place for a Barn Owl.  The first picture is of the Barn Owl perched in the cupula.  To my distress, my presence there flushed the owl despite my best efforts. I guess it is unlikely a creature that can hear a mouse's heartbeat under six inches of snow would be unaware of an intruder in its roost.   I heard Blue Jays scolding outside and found the owl in dense trees for the subsequent pictures.  I then left without disturbing it further.  The landowner said he had seen two ""white owls"" there in mid September.  He has never seen any young.  This post is delayed as I was researching the appropriate response to this siting.  I registered the siting with Anna Buckardt, the Avian ecologist for the Iowa DNR.  She told me the location would be kept under wraps at the DNR and used for monitoring Barn Owl populations.  She is aware of only about 13 nesting sites in Iowa.  It is my understanding that locations of nesting sites should be reported as county only.  I will look forward to asking the landowner next year if they came back and hopefully produced offspring.",Tyto furcata,brnowl,Species,8537,,3.67,3,,2053,3000

We arrived at the barn owl box just before sunset and decided to park and wait in our vehicle. Having never seen a barn owl before, we were excited at the possibility of glimpsing one. Just after sunset, we were rewarded with two barn owl faces showing in the window.   About ten or fifteen minutes later, one of the barn owls perched in the window and took flight to a nearby tree. The second owl popped up into the window, with a third showing its face! The second owl then flew from the box and joined the first in the tree. To our surprise, after the second owl left, a fourth one popped into view! The third owl (we believe to be a fledgling) poked its head out the window and seemed to be looking around and calculating how to join its parents. It was bobbing and circling its head repeatedly. After a couple of minutes of that, the third owl perched in the window and took a sort of clumsy flight to the same tree as the first two.   After it left, a fifth owl face came into view! The fourth and fifth owls spent the next several minutes looking out of the box, seemingly trying to figure out how to join their parents and sibling. After a lot of head circling, the fourth owl perched in the window, but was much less confident than the third. At one point, it seemed to lose its balance and nearly fell from the box! It held on with talons and used its wings to prevent the fall, then retreated into the box. A moment later it was back perching, and after more calculating, it launched and took a downward arc toward the trees (we cheered inside the car).  Light was fading quickly by now, but we hoped to see the fifth one fly as well. Despite perching in the window multiple times, it retreated back to the box every time. Several times it stood sideways in the window and stuck one wing out and flapped. We ended up leaving before it left the box, simply because we could barely see it anymore. As the last one was contemplating leaving, on of the parents went on top of the box seemingly trying to encourage it. That parent then flew to a tree near us and began screaming, which we had never heard before. Overall an awesome experience!   We are presuming that the five owls in the box are a family, with the first two the parents. They were quick to leave the box, waited in the trees, flew around to several trees nearby, and also landed on top of the corn crib and the nest box. They also showed good flying ability. We then figured the last three were their young who were hesitant leaving the box and seemed clumsy in their flight. I read that young barn owls may return to their nest box to roost even after their first flight. Based on the behavior we saw, we're wondering if this was close to their first flight (if not the first, after seeing the fifth owl so unsure of flying).

Five cold abandoned eggs which should have been big chicks on this date. It’s possible that the eggs were abandoned during the extreme cold weather we had in late December (below zero and windy for multiple days)  Encountered while performing necessary nest box maintenance (cleaning out and making small repairs when needed). Nest boxes are maintained periodically (about once every 5 years) during the fall/winter season when nests are less likely to be active, in order to reduce disturbance to these state-endangered birds.  Nest boxes help barn owls by giving them a safe place to roost and nest. You can help barn owls by donating to the Nongame Wildlife Fund, or by building and installing a nest box in open grassland habitat.

I edited out red-eye in post-processing,While just starting to record the Chuck wills widow which was singing spontaneously as we walked in . A barn owl also called out so I have that on the recording. I have heard it call a few times before and sometimes have not reported it because I’ve been unable to record it or photograph it. Luckily this time the bird was visible with a flashlight  in a royal palm and I was able to take flash photos of it. I took more photos so finally I’ve documented it. It has been here for at least 2 to 3 years intermittently -- have no idea where it’s breeding but it seems to prefer this general area where I found it This morning,Tyto furcata,brnowl,Species,8537,,4.00,2,,1094,1458

We arrived at the barn owl box just before sunset and decided to park and wait in our vehicle. Having never seen a barn owl before, we were excited at the possibility of glimpsing one. Just after sunset, we were rewarded with two barn owl faces showing in the window.   About ten or fifteen minutes later, one of the barn owls perched in the window and took flight to a nearby tree. The second owl popped up into the window, with a third showing its face! The second owl then flew from the box and joined the first in the tree. To our surprise, after the second owl left, a fourth one popped into view! The third owl (we believe to be a fledgling) poked its head out the window and seemed to be looking around and calculating how to join its parents. It was bobbing and circling its head repeatedly. After a couple of minutes of that, the third owl perched in the window and took a sort of clumsy flight to the same tree as the first two.   After it left, a fifth owl face came into view! The fourth and fifth owls spent the next several minutes looking out of the box, seemingly trying to figure out how to join their parents and sibling. After a lot of head circling, the fourth owl perched in the window, but was much less confident than the third. At one point, it seemed to lose its balance and nearly fell from the box! It held on with talons and used its wings to prevent the fall, then retreated into the box. A moment later it was back perching, and after more calculating, it launched and took a downward arc toward the trees (we cheered inside the car).  Light was fading quickly by now, but we hoped to see the fifth one fly as well. Despite perching in the window multiple times, it retreated back to the box every time. Several times it stood sideways in the window and stuck one wing out and flapped. We ended up leaving before it left the box, simply because we could barely see it anymore. As the last one was contemplating leaving, on of the parents went on top of the box seemingly trying to encourage it. That parent then flew to a tree near us and began screaming, which we had never heard before. Overall an awesome experience!   We are presuming that the five owls in the box are a family, with the first two the parents. They were quick to leave the box, waited in the trees, flew around to several trees nearby, and also landed on top of the corn crib and the nest box. They also showed good flying ability. We then figured the last three were their young who were hesitant leaving the box and seemed clumsy in their flight. I read that young barn owls may return to their nest box to roost even after their first flight. Based on the behavior we saw, we're wondering if this was close to their first flight (if not the first, after seeing the fifth owl so unsure of flying).  Hopefully the last owl joined them later in the night!",Tyto furcata,brnowl,Species,8537,,3.33,3,,2277,3416

We arrived at the barn owl box just before sunset and decided to park and wait in our vehicle. Having never seen a barn owl before, we were excited at the possibility of glimpsing one. Just after sunset, we were rewarded with two barn owl faces showing in the window.   About ten or fifteen minutes later, one of the barn owls perched in the window and took flight to a nearby tree. The second owl popped up into the window, with a third showing its face! The second owl then flew from the box and joined the first in the tree. To our surprise, after the second owl left, a fourth one popped into view! The third owl (we believe to be a fledgling) poked its head out the window and seemed to be looking around and calculating how to join its parents. It was bobbing and circling its head repeatedly. After a couple of minutes of that, the third owl perched in the window and took a sort of clumsy flight to the same tree as the first two.   After it left, a fifth owl face came into view! The fourth and fifth owls spent the next several minutes looking out of the box, seemingly trying to figure out how to join their parents and sibling. After a lot of head circling, the fourth owl perched in the window, but was much less confident than the third. At one point, it seemed to lose its balance and nearly fell from the box! It held on with talons and used its wings to prevent the fall, then retreated into the box. A moment later it was back perching, and after more calculating, it launched and took a downward arc toward the trees (we cheered inside the car).  Light was fading quickly by now, but we hoped to see the fifth one fly as well. Despite perching in the window multiple times, it retreated back to the box every time. Several times it stood sideways in the window and stuck one wing out and flapped. We ended up leaving before it left the box, simply because we could barely see it anymore. As the last one was contemplating leaving, on of the parents went on top of the box seemingly trying to encourage it. That parent then flew to a tree near us and began screaming, which we had never heard before. Overall an awesome experience!   We are presuming that the five owls in the box are a family, with the first two the parents. They were quick to leave the box, waited in the trees, flew around to several trees nearby, and also landed on top of the corn crib and the nest box. They also showed good flying ability. We then figured the last three were their young who were hesitant leaving the box and seemed clumsy in their flight. I read that young barn owls may return to their nest box to roost even after their first flight. Based on the behavior we saw, we're wondering if this was close to their first flight (if not the first, after seeing the fifth owl so unsure of flying).  Hopefully the last owl joined them later in the night!",Tyto furcata,brnowl,Species,8537,,3.25,4,,2264,3396

All were seen while performing necessary nest box maintenance (cleaning out and making small repairs to the box when needed). The amount of fresh pellet mass inside the box that had the adult roosting inside the box indicated that there was a nest in the box in 2017. The box with at least four older chicks was not disturbed. These chicks were right on the verge of fledging or had recently fledged and were still roosting inside the box. Small tufts of down were visible in the breasts if these owls. Since this is a dangerous time in the lives of naive young barn owls, we did not want to flush them from their nest box. Another visit will be made in a couple months after chicks have dispersed and the box will be cleaned out then. Nest boxes help barn owls by giving them a safe place to roost and nest. You can help barn owls by donating to the Nongame Fund, or by building and installing a nest box in open grassland habitat.

I grabbed a few photos on Brown's Farm at south end before totally dark. I would not shine a light to take an owl's photo, but while I was snapping a photo of one on the powerline I realized this one was right there on the road in my headlights so I did snap the photo since the poor guy already had light in his eyes.

The adult was perched in the eastern silo and unmoving and had a flat, heart-shaped white face with the dark eyes apparently closed and a dark nose ridge running down towards the beak, the crown was a reddish-brown, with a white breast with some small dark spotting and light brownish-red wings and back also with dark spotting. There was a dark spot in the center of the lower belly which may have been a foot. Closed eyes can be a part of a threat display. The owlet was all white with large dark eyes and a long face and large beak. Possibly wearing it's second downy coat, as the belly had down on it. Evidently Barn Owls are the only owls to get two down coats as owlets, with the first sparse on the belly and with down covering the legs to the claws. The owlet lacked any down on the lower legs and had much down on the belly, so likely it's second down coat. They are said to feather between 3rd and 7th week, fly @ 60 days, and be independent @ 10 weeks.   The adult was perched in the eastern silo, which is @ 175 feet from the western silo which contained silage and was where the owlet was.  The adult had been with the owlet in the filled west silo, but had moved after the daily 4 PM silage removal was performed. The best time to view the adult would be after 4 PM as it flies to the empty eastern silo after silage is removed from the western silo where the owlet is at. According to the property owner the adult will stay in the eastern silo for some time. It was there until 830 PM one night.  Evidently the owlet had hatched @ one month ago as that was when the owlet was first seen. It was found in the western silo which was full of silage and had first been opened up in January.  The owlet was left alone after it was first found until the silage had rotted to a depth of about seven (7) feet and had to be removed. Then it was moved up to the higher part of the silage while the rotten silage was removed.    The owlet was seen today in the western silo. It was at the highest point of the silage and near the wall of the silo. It did not care for company as it was continually hissing for the approximate minute that it was observed. Since there is only one owlet it raises the probability it will be well fed.  Females alone incubates and broods the young, with the male bringing food, but owlets may be tended and fed by both parents.  The average lifespan of a wild Barn Owl is 20.9 months. 60-85 % of Barn Owls die in their first year before breeding. Most birds of 260 birds in one study in Utah, at the northern edge of the Barn Owls range, had only one successful breeding season. Of course successful breeding does not mean these birds were fit as fitness is measured by the successful breeding and rearing of young by the 2nd generation. It doesn't mean an animal is fit if it merely raises young, the young need to be reproductive.    Everything else. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/bird-cams-faq-barn-owl-nest/  https://www.owlresearchinstitute.org/barn-owl   Colder than normal weather and/or increased snow cover increases starvation rate  https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v087n01/p0111-p0115.pdf  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/14/barn-owls-threatened-freak-weather  PhD Thesis on Sibling Rivraly in the Barn Owl  2nd App shows that darker owlets gave food to their younger siblings and lighter owlets stole food.

All were seen while performing necessary nest box maintenance (cleaning out and making small repairs to the box when needed). The amount of fresh pellet mass inside the box that had the adult roosting inside the box indicated that there was a nest in the box in 2017. The box with at least four older chicks was not disturbed. These chicks were right on the verge of fledging or had recently fledged and were still roosting inside the box. Small tufts of down were visible in the breasts if these owls. Since this is a dangerous time in the lives of naive young barn owls, we did not want to flush them from their nest box. Another visit will be made in a couple months after chicks have dispersed and the box will be cleaned out then. Nest boxes help barn owls by giving them a safe place to roost and nest. You can help barn owls by donating to the Nongame Fund, or by building and installing a nest box in open grassland habitat.

The adult was perched in the eastern silo and unmoving and had a flat, heart-shaped white face with the dark eyes apparently closed and a dark nose ridge running down towards the beak, the crown was a reddish-brown, with a white breast with some small dark spotting and light brownish-red wings and back also with dark spotting. There was a dark spot in the center of the lower belly which may have been a foot. Closed eyes can be a part of a threat display. The owlet was all white with large dark eyes and a long face and large beak. Possibly wearing it's second downy coat, as the belly had down on it. Evidently Barn Owls are the only owls to get two down coats as owlets, with the first sparse on the belly and with down covering the legs to the claws. The owlet lacked any down on the lower legs and had much down on the belly, so likely it's second down coat. They are said to feather between 3rd and 7th week, fly @ 60 days, and be independent @ 10 weeks.   The adult was perched in the eastern silo, which is @ 175 feet from the western silo which contained silage and was where the owlet was.  The adult had been with the owlet in the filled west silo, but had moved after the daily 4 PM silage removal was performed. The best time to view the adult would be after 4 PM as it flies to the empty eastern silo after silage is removed from the western silo where the owlet is at. According to the property owner the adult will stay in the eastern silo for some time. It was there until 830 PM one night.  Evidently the owlet had hatched @ one month ago as that was when the owlet was first seen. It was found in the western silo which was full of silage and had first been opened up in January.  The owlet was left alone after it was first found until the silage had rotted to a depth of about seven (7) feet and had to be removed. Then it was moved up to the higher part of the silage while the rotten silage was removed.    The owlet was seen today in the western silo. It was at the highest point of the silage and near the wall of the silo. It did not care for company as it was continually hissing for the approximate minute that it was observed. Since there is only one owlet it raises the probability it will be well fed.  Females alone incubates and broods the young, with the male bringing food, but owlets may be tended and fed by both parents.  The average lifespan of a wild Barn Owl is 20.9 months. 60-85 % of Barn Owls die in their first year before breeding. Most birds of 260 birds in one study in Utah, at the northern edge of the Barn Owls range, had only one successful breeding season. Of course successful breeding does not mean these birds were fit as fitness is measured by the successful breeding and rearing of young by the 2nd generation. It doesn't mean an animal is fit if it merely raises young, the young need to be reproductive.    Everything else. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/bird-cams-faq-barn-owl-nest/  https://www.owlresearchinstitute.org/barn-owl   Colder than normal weather and/or increased snow cover increases starvation rate  https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v087n01/p0111-p0115.pdf  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/14/barn-owls-threatened-freak-weather  PhD Thesis on Sibling Rivraly in the Barn Owl  2nd App shows that darker owlets gave food to their younger siblings and lighter owlets stole food.

The adult was perched in the eastern silo and unmoving and had a flat, heart-shaped white face with the dark eyes apparently closed and a dark nose ridge running down towards the beak, the crown was a reddish-brown, with a white breast with some small dark spotting and light brownish-red wings and back also with dark spotting. There was a dark spot in the center of the lower belly which may have been a foot. Closed eyes can be a part of a threat display. The owlet was all white with large dark eyes and a long face and large beak. Possibly wearing it's second downy coat, as the belly had down on it. Evidently Barn Owls are the only owls to get two down coats as owlets, with the first sparse on the belly and with down covering the legs to the claws. The owlet lacked any down on the lower legs and had much down on the belly, so likely it's second down coat. They are said to feather between 3rd and 7th week, fly @ 60 days, and be independent @ 10 weeks.   The adult was perched in the eastern silo, which is @ 175 feet from the western silo which contained silage and was where the owlet was.  The adult had been with the owlet in the filled west silo, but had moved after the daily 4 PM silage removal was performed. The best time to view the adult would be after 4 PM as it flies to the empty eastern silo after silage is removed from the western silo where the owlet is at. According to the property owner the adult will stay in the eastern silo for some time. It was there until 830 PM one night.  Evidently the owlet had hatched @ one month ago as that was when the owlet was first seen. It was found in the western silo which was full of silage and had first been opened up in January.  The owlet was left alone after it was first found until the silage had rotted to a depth of about seven (7) feet and had to be removed. Then it was moved up to the higher part of the silage while the rotten silage was removed.    The owlet was seen today in the western silo. It was at the highest point of the silage and near the wall of the silo. It did not care for company as it was continually hissing for the approximate minute that it was observed.

Mesmerized by the bird, and mainly focusing on it's face, I didn't notice when taking photos initially, that the bird was actually trapped by twine that essentially attached it's foot to the branch.   Another birder called Bay Raptor Rescue, and I returned to the bulb with my wife (after she alerted me to the situation) to try to assist with the rescue, bringing an extra ladder and additional tools. The bird was difficult to rescue, but after perhaps several hours of efforts - involving sawing the branch to leave the bird and branch swinging from the twine, then attempting to cut the twine - the bird was freed and placed in a cardboard pet carrier. The bird was taken to the Lindsay Museum, where it will be rehydrated, its wounds assessed and bandaged and any other issues treated.     Thanks to Craig Nikitas of Bay Bird Rescue who did some serious 'McGyvering' - including tying a slip not to a pole to trap the end of the cut branch to prevent the bird flying away with the branch once the twine was cut. He also balanced precariously on a tall ladder, while I stood on a smaller ladder and handed him tools. My wife, Adrienne assisted from the ground. The bird had serious abrasions to it's leg and foot, and we were unsure whether constriction from the string had caused nerve damage or impairment of the foot. I plan to call the Lindsay Museum in a day or two to ask for an update.",Tyto furcata,brnowl,Species,8537,,3.00,1,,2423,1817
