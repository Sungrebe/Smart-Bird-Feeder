I went outside and spotted the bird perched on the fence on the east side of the yard. I went back into the house to grab my camera and gradually began to approach the bird. It was so intent on potential prey that it allowed me to get within 20’. It stayed on the fence until I was satisfied as far as photos went. It disappeared while I was busy filling the birds feeders. While doing so I heard agitated vocalizations from House Sparrows in the hedge, as well as rustling noises. This was followed by an exodus of HOSP from the hedge. I waited for the SSHA to emerge in pursuit, but I did not see it, so I finished up my feeder filling task. When done, as I walked toward the back door, I saw the SSHA on the ground next to the hedge, standing in a pile of feathers. I was able to observe and photograph the bird from inside the house as it fed for an extended period. The SSHA eventually flew to an oak tree where it continued its meal. I went out to obtain additional photos. When the bird moved to a higher perch I went inside. This was the most prolonged encounter with this species in the yard (where its an annual winter visitor), or anywhere for that matter. It was the most confiding (or distracted/innocent/hungry) individual by far. No bigger than a BLJA, so presumably a male.",Accipiter striatus,shshaw,Species,8161,,5.00,3,,2056,2872

It appeared to consider the Flickers potential prey, but the Flickers allowed the bird quite close and it was not always clear who was chasing whom among the branches.    A first year accipiter that I was unable to ID, but per Willie D'Anna  ""there are some characters on this bird that fairly conclusively point to an ID. First are the streaks on the ventral body. They are thick and blobby, especially on the belly. On Cooper's the streaks would be thinning out more than this. Next is the relative length of the tail feathers. Although the outer feathers are shorter, the difference is much less than on a Cooper's. Although a bit more subjective, the head shape appears better for a Sharpy, with a small head and a more central eye location. Also, the head shape on a Cooper's is usually more squarish at the nape. Finally, young Cooper's tend to be more orange-buff on the head and this bird shows no such tone.""",Accipiter striatus,shshaw,Species,8161,,4.00,4,,2434,1619

My birding partner at first thought she had seen a Blue Jay as we drove by.  We stopped and found this hawk. The far away pic is not cropped, shot with a 400 mm lens from across the road.  Size:  This is a small bird, about the size of large Blue Jay or Mourning Dove.  Body:  Though looking a bit chubby for a Sharpie, it was sort of hunkered down giving it the barrel shape look of a Coopers Hawk.  Color: The nape and back were distinctly the same gray color pattern.  Legs and Feet:  The legs are hidden but the foot showing is thin in comparison to the Coopers.  Tail:  The true length is hidden because of the angle of view but lacks the distinct bold white tip of the Coopers. Flight:  The observed flight was away from us and brief.  The wings were short but wide and the flight pattern was  to flap it's wings a few times then glide, then repeat as it headed for more dense forest. Overall, because of the size and flight characteristics we conclude that this is a Sharp-shinned Hawk.",Accipiter striatus,shshaw,Species,8161,,4.33,3,,1050,840

The SSHA landed for less than 1 minute in a <i>Juniperus scopulorum</i> at the edge of the yard. Before it landed, a large HOFI flock had flushed and headed to the N or NE; a smaller group of HOFI followed at about the time that the SSHA landed. The hawk gave chase, one bird was not tight with the flock, and the hawk did amazing aerial braking and apparently caught the bird in midair over Hoback St ca 70 m N of the <i>Juniperus scopulorum</i>; it flew W with the bird in its talons. We flushed it from another <i>J. scopulorum</i> in a backyard W of Hoback St. It flew to a deciduous tree along the alley W of Hoback, where it fed while perched on a large horizontal branch about halfway up in the tree, looking around frequently. At 1654 it flew up to near the top of a deciduous tree (not positive it was the same tree; we were more distant at that point), then flew off to the SW. Rapid, strong wingbeats, rather snappy like MERL.  **Note: I suspect the prey was a HOFI based on the circumstances, but am not positive. I got a video of the hawk feeding, and may be able to confirm prey species from this. <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/eE6b-qQlVAE"" frameborder=""0""></iframe>",Accipiter striatus,shshaw,Species,8161,,4.33,3,,2608,3560

They would suddenly swoop down to the feeders and try to pluck a bird from the ground or from the feeder. We saw him take a junco. The juvenile Sharp-shinned Hawk has been hanging around our house for about two months. We see him sitting in the juniper trees behind our house. Then we see him fly to the front of the house to try to catch a bird from the bird feeder.If he is successful, he takes the bird back to a tree behind the house to eat it. We have about 4 acres of pinon -juniper forest and we see him out the window early in the morning. he may change his position, but may be nearby at any time.

None were present. Later, a male downy and a pine warbler landed in the same crabapple tree. Both were watched intently by the hawk before they flew away. A chickadee then landed in the crabapple tree also watched by the hawk before it flew away. Thirty-five minutes after the hawk landed, a pine siskin landed in the crabapple tree on a large limb with fewer small branches in the vicinity of the siskin. The siskin immediately caught the hawk’s attention, as the hawk repositioned itself in attack pose. Unaware of the nearby hawk, the siskin flew down toward the feeders. The hawk shot off his perch in pursuit of the siskin. The chase began as both birds swooped toward ground level toward the house. Our view was briefly obscured but the hawk circled toward the neighbors yard. At this point I was unable to determine if the hawk had caught his prey. I then saw the hawk glide through the shrubs in the backyard and perch on a distant stump. He had succeeded in catching his prey. My view was greatly obscured by deciduous shrubs but I was able to see the hawk plucking feathers from his prey. It is now 3 pm. I looked up from telling my story. Low-and-behold, the hawk has returned to the crabapple tree.  Note: This is our first record of a Sharp-shinned Hawk on eBird. A couple years ago I was able to rescue a Sharp-shinned hawk knocked unconscious after flying into our house.  ID details: 1) Hawk about the size of a blue jay; 2) Body shape, triangular, broader at shoulders tapering to legs; 3) Lacks helmet look of a Cooper’s Hawk; 4) Continuation of brown color from back of head, down shoulders and down the back in certain head positions.  A Cooper Hawk generally displays a coloration break at neck; 5) Wide banded striped tail, front view-white and dark stripes, (see photo); back view-dark and tan brown wide stripes (no photo).  Photos by GA.",Accipiter striatus,shshaw,Species,8161,,5.00,2,,3456,4608

I went outside and spotted the bird perched on the fence on the east side of the yard. I went back into the house to grab my camera and gradually began to approach the bird. It was so intent on potential prey that it allowed me to get within 20’. It stayed on the fence until I was satisfied as far as photos went. It disappeared while I was busy filling the birds feeders. While doing so I heard agitated vocalizations from House Sparrows in the hedge, as well as rustling noises. This was followed by an exodus of HOSP from the hedge. I waited for the SSHA to emerge in pursuit, but I did not see it, so I finished up my feeder filling task. When done, as I walked toward the back door, I saw the SSHA on the ground next to the hedge, standing in a pile of feathers. I was able to observe and photograph the bird from inside the house as it fed for an extended period. The SSHA eventually flew to an oak tree where it continued its meal. I went out to obtain additional photos. When the bird moved to a higher perch I went inside. This was the most prolonged encounter with this species in the yard (where its an annual winter visitor), or anywhere for that matter. It was the most confiding (or distracted/innocent/hungry) individual by far. No bigger than a BLJA, so presumably a male.",Accipiter striatus,shshaw,Species,8161,,5.00,2,,4552,3345

After about 25 minutes it took off after a bird and was gone for 5 minutes before it returned and again perched for a long period on the brush pile.  After it left the brush pile for good I saw it 3 more times. Once it landed in a tree 25 feed from where I was standing, once it came in fast and low just above the ground in my back yard and once it went to the ground after a bird at the brush pile.   Amazing how it can fly through trees at high speed, which it did twice today so far.

I watched (and video-taped) the encounter for 8 minutes, during which time both bird kept screaming at each other; the jay grabbed one of the hawk's legs with its foot and the other in its beak, and the hawk proceeded to pluck feathers from the jay's breast. A few times, the hawk tried to carry the jay off, but it appeared to be too heavy. Suddenly, the hawk let go of the jay and flew up to land on a power line, while the jay escaped into the bushes. I looked up from the camera and saw that a cat had approached the birds and scared the hawk off. It went after the jay into the brush, but reappeared shortly after without a bird, so maybe the jay got away.

I watched (and video-taped) the encounter for 8 minutes, during which time both bird kept screaming at each other; the jay grabbed one of the hawk's legs with its foot and the other in its beak, and the hawk proceeded to pluck feathers from the jay's breast. A few times, the hawk tried to carry the jay off, but it appeared to be too heavy. Suddenly, the hawk let go of the jay and flew up to land on a power line, while the jay escaped into the bushes. I looked up from the camera and saw that a cat had approached the birds and scared the hawk off. It went after the jay into the brush, but reappeared shortly after without a bird, so maybe the jay got away.

The hawk in question was observed for more than two minutes sitting on the wire approximately 30 feet from us. We concluded it was a SSHA for the following reasons though it should be noted that our i.d. is based on several features as observed in the field rather than just focusing on a single characteristic, namely the roundish tail seen in the photo.   This is a juvenile hawk as evidenced by the streaking on the chest and belly. The streaking is broad and teardrop-shaped and remains the same in pattern from the chest to far down on the belly. On a COHA, the steaking would be finer, somewhat denser on the chest and less dense on the upper belly. However, this characteristic is variable and separation of SSHA and COHA should not rely on a single characteristic.   The eye of this hawk is located in the center of a rather rounded head (second photograph) giving the bird an alert look. The eye on a COHA would be closer to the beak, giving the bird a slightly ""angry"" look, and the head would be more ""blocky"" in shape. Also, the legs on this hawk appear very thin and spindly and do not seem as robust as would be typical of a COHA.   The tail is curious on this bird as it looks somewhat rounded as would be expected on a COHA but the tail feathers on a COHA usually have a stacked look and broad white tips, though in juvenile COHA the white tips wear off over time. This hawk shows very little white if any on the tips of the tail feathers. One tail feather (on the right) is visibly shorter than the rest which is similar to COHA however the corresponding tail feather on the left is the same length as the other tail feathers suggesting SSHA and that perhaps, for whatever reason, the shorter tail feather has not come in all the way.   Finally, this was a very small hawk. We observed a Blue Jay (BLJA) vigorously scolding the hawk which is why the bird is turned to the right of the frame in the second photograph. Thus, we had a direct size comparison at the time of the observation. This hawk was roughly the same size as the BLJA (approximately 11 inches length). To confirm the size I measured the distance between the two wires based on the point the photograph was taken and was able to confirm that the hawk was approximately 11½ inches in length from the tip of the tail to the top of the head. Therefore, based on all the aforementioned characteristics, including streaking, head-shape, location of the eye, tail characteristics, thin legs and the size, we concluded that this is an immature SSHA.",Accipiter striatus,shshaw,Species,8161,,3.75,4,,3000,4000

At first I thought two red winged blackbirds as they seemed similar in size, but then I realized that one was brownish and just a little bigger than the other. The hawk pinned the blackbird against the base of a tree, blackbird shrieking-but then the prey won out! The tree was raised out of the water with roots almost like stilts-the bb wiggled under the tree and flew out, via the roots, making a narrow escape. The sharpie (which I’d ID’d at this point, based on its tiny size) flew to a tree branch, no doubt annoyed that it missed what seemed like a sure meal. I stood rooted to the spot, amazed at what I was seeing. The ruckus was so loud that the sleeping, nesting swan looked over to see what was happening. When it was done I noticed that the mallard I’d spied, just before this all happened, was still there, staring at where it had all gone down. He didn’t move, probably as shocked as I was at the close proximity of all this excitement. I actually took a photo of him in this state lol.",Accipiter striatus,shshaw,Species,8161,,4.50,2,,2395,1731

But both in the field, and especially later, while looking at our photos of the bird (which was circling for a bit over YRP), I felt it was a Sharp-shinned Hawk based on several features.  In life it impressed as a small bird (though of course that not diagnostic in itself), looked small-headed, kept its wings pulled forward slightly, typical of SSHA (which also contributes to the minimal ""head projection"").  In the images that show enough detail, the underparts depict a juvenile bird (dominated by vertical streaking in the center of the breast but also showing some horizontal barring on the sides/flanks, more typical of SSHA); also the underparts appear somewhat more coarsely pattered, slightly better for SSHA. The white terminal band to the tail seemed fairly narrow, especially for a bird that should still be in relatively fresh plumage (not a whole lot of difference, but I'd think a fresh Cooper's would show a slightly wider white terminal band). And lastly, the tail appeared relatively short to the bird's overall size, for an Accipiter (although this being another feature which can be fairly subjective).",Accipiter striatus,shshaw,Species,8161,,4.50,2,,1231,1815

In particular a study of the tail, I had thought it might be Cooper's at first, since the outer tail feathers that are visible seemed shorter than the central ones, giving it a somewhat rounded look, BUT, Alvaro helped me to understand the following which makes this a Sharpie!  TAIL: ""The shape of Cooper's is more rounded and also longer, so the shorter rectrix is actually not unusual on Sharpie, but having a stack of central rectrices that are very similar in length would be unusual in Cooper's. They usually show the graduation within the central feathers too. As well, usually Cooper's has a broader white terminal band.""  EYE/HEAD: ""The owl like (pygmy owl look) of big eyes and seemingly smaller head is classic of Sharpie. Cooper's tends to have that flat capped look, and small eyes that are closer up to the bill. They look meaner, while sharpies look surprised. That is the look I see in your photo.""  NAPE: ""That cinnamon on the nape also looks good for Sharpie.""",Accipiter striatus,shshaw,Species,8161,,4.50,2,,2060,3089

I saw many BLJA initially so I stopped at the Young's Mountain Road. The AMCR were on the ground when I realized there was a Sharp-shinned Hawk and it had just captured a BLJA. The struggle to dispatch the BAJA took about 8 to 10 minutes which I tried to capture below. The BLJA was fighting valiantly and was calling loudly initially. There was a mobbing of sorts going on initially which included some BLJA and AMCR. I changed position but kept a good distance away capturing unique moments. Finally the BLJA stopped fighting and the SSHA flew off just as I looked away briefly, it was gone.
