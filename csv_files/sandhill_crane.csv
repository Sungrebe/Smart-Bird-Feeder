I got much better views today than yesterday, as the bird was foraging remarkably close to Upper Bay Rd. Adding to my rather basic comments from yesterday (a large, lanky bird, with long legs and a thin, long neck; generally gray overall with some brown on the coverts), today, I was able to view a lot of fine plumage details, especially on the head and neck. This bird has thin, orange eye-rings, and its irises appear to be a dark orangish color. It also has a rusty orange crown, which is a distinctly different color from the pinkish red on the loral area and forehead. I also noticed fairly extensive white mottling along the sides of the head and neck. This bird did not appear to be bothered by my presence at all, occasionally passing within 6-7 feet of me. It did seem to be concerned by the ravens and turkey vultures that would pass overhead, glancing up when they flew by. Of note, I also watched it inflate its throat a few times, giving a croak sound while doing so. Not sure what that means. Super glad I made the 2nd trip to see it again.",Antigone canadensis,sancra,Species,5643,,4.80,40,,3101,4135

I got much better views today than yesterday, as the bird was foraging remarkably close to Upper Bay Rd. Adding to my rather basic comments from yesterday (a large, lanky bird, with long legs and a thin, long neck; generally gray overall with some brown on the coverts), today, I was able to view a lot of fine plumage details, especially on the head and neck. This bird has thin, orange eye-rings, and its irises appear to be a dark orangish color. It also has a rusty orange crown, which is a distinctly different color from the pinkish red on the loral area and forehead. I also noticed fairly extensive white mottling along the sides of the head and neck. This bird did not appear to be bothered by my presence at all, occasionally passing within 6-7 feet of me. It did seem to be concerned by the ravens and turkey vultures that would pass overhead, glancing up when they flew by. Of note, I also watched it inflate its throat a few times, giving a croak sound while doing so. Not sure what that means.

I got much better views today than yesterday, as the bird was foraging remarkably close to Upper Bay Rd. Adding to my rather basic comments from yesterday (a large, lanky bird, with long legs and a thin, long neck; generally gray overall with some brown on the coverts), today, I was able to view a lot of fine plumage details, especially on the head and neck. This bird has thin, orange eye-rings, and its irises appear to be a dark orangish color. It also has a rusty orange crown, which is a distinctly different color from the pinkish red on the loral area and forehead. I also noticed fairly extensive white mottling along the sides of the head and neck. This bird did not appear to be bothered by my presence at all, occasionally passing within 6-7 feet of me. It did seem to be concerned by the ravens and turkey vultures that would pass overhead, glancing up when they flew by. Of note, I also watched it inflate its throat a few times, giving a croak sound while doing so. Not sure what that means. Super glad I made the 2nd trip to see it again.",Antigone canadensis,sancra,Species,5643,,5.00,4,,2816,3755

This bird has thin, orange eye-rings, and its irises appear to be a dark orangish color. It also has a rusty orange crown, which is a distinctly different color from the pinkish red on the loral area and forehead. I also noticed fairly extensive white mottling along the sides of the head and neck. This bird did not appear to be bothered by my presence at all, occasionally passing within 6-7 feet of me. It did seem to be concerned by the ravens and turkey vultures that would pass overhead, glancing up when they flew by. Of note, I also watched it inflate its throat a few times, giving a croak sound while doing so. Not sure what that means.

I got much better views today than yesterday, as the bird was foraging remarkably close to Upper Bay Rd. Adding to my rather basic comments from yesterday (a large, lanky bird, with long legs and a thin, long neck; generally gray overall with some brown on the coverts), today, I was able to view a lot of fine plumage details, especially on the head and neck. This bird has thin, orange eye-rings, and its irises appear to be a dark orangish color. It also has a rusty orange crown, which is a distinctly different color from the pinkish red on the loral area and forehead. I also noticed fairly extensive white mottling along the sides of the head and neck. This bird did not appear to be bothered by my presence at all, occasionally passing within 6-7 feet of me. It did seem to be concerned by the ravens and turkey vultures that would pass overhead, glancing up when they flew by. Of note, I also watched it inflate its throat a few times, giving a croak sound while doing so. Not sure what that means. Super glad I made the 2nd trip to see it again.",Antigone canadensis,sancra,Species,5643,,4.20,5,,3327,4436

Judging by size, two appeared to be males, three females. One presumed male was calling frequently. Considering successful nesting/fledging of two offspring in the general area in 2019 (unknown until recently), 2021, and 2022, we speculated about the origin of these birds and whether they may have born in somewhere in this southeast-Quabbin region. It takes 2-3 years for immature birds to acquire adult plumage. These are not any of the two adults with recently fledged young reported more than 2 weeks ago.

I got much better views today than yesterday, as the bird was foraging remarkably close to Upper Bay Rd. Adding to my rather basic comments from yesterday (a large, lanky bird, with long legs and a thin, long neck; generally gray overall with some brown on the coverts), today, I was able to view a lot of fine plumage details, especially on the head and neck. This bird has thin, orange eye-rings, and its irises appear to be a dark orangish color. It also has a rusty orange crown, which is a distinctly different color from the pinkish red on the loral area and forehead. I also noticed fairly extensive white mottling along the sides of the head and neck. This bird did not appear to be bothered by my presence at all, occasionally passing within 6-7 feet of me. It did seem to be concerned by the ravens and turkey vultures that would pass overhead, glancing up when they flew by. Of note, I also watched it inflate its throat a few times, giving a croak sound while doing so. Not sure what that means. Super glad I made the 2nd trip to see it again.",Antigone canadensis,sancra,Species,5643,,4.67,3,,3082,4109

Large flocks previously seen to the south were seen heading to this resting/roosting area. Hardly any (400) seen on the north side of 1000S today and none on the east side of 500E or out in the open in the ag land north and south of 1100S.  This weeks worth of highly documented surveys should convince you that the filter needs to be changed for LaPorte Co, as has repeatedly been suggested at the bottom of the last paragragh; Change the filter to 20,000 as it is for Starke Co, which is less than two (2) miles to the south. Jackson and Green Counties also have 20,000 as the filter cutoff. , and Starke County. LaPorte County is an adjacent county to Jasper-Pulaski and the SACR are only going to continue increasing.   Although this count of 7,360 is just an on-ground count with no dusk flight count the SACR on ground numbers dropped in the past two daily readings from the on-ground high of 13,900 on 11.29.17 and also from 12,480 on 12.04.17, just four (4) days ago. Excluding the first count the mean on-ground count from 11.29.17 through 12.06.17 was 11,081. The drop in the on-ground count is associated with the drop in the temperature, as would be expected. The temperature dropped down to 13.5 F at 0515 at the LaPorte Municipal Airport, and down to 12.6 F at Kingsford Heights  this AM. Although in speaking with the man that plows the local roads some do remain around during the winter as he stated that they would be out in the road when he was plowing.   Surveyed this area intensively for @ one week. Had 10,400 on 11.26.17; 14,900 on 11.29; and 17,350 on 12.01; 15,605 on 12.02.17; 16,803 on 12.03.17; 17,080 on 12.04.17, 11,100 on 12.06.17; and 7,360 on 12.08.17 ( which did not include the dusk flight count.). Fairly consistent counts until the cold weather hit.  Believe numbers dropped the last two days due to the colder weather causing migration.  17,000 previously reported for LaPorte Co in March of 2015 http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S22388042 without any supporting documentation   and the SACR population is experiencing an increase. Not this many were here two (2) years ago. Many other local checklists by several observers from earlier this year showing 5,000-8,000 SACR @ 5 miles to the SW of this roosting location. It is 23 miles to Jasper-Pulaski.  This observation was continued until dusk to include the SACR flying in to roost as observer had knowledge and experience of seeing large flocks nearby earlier this year. There are no other dusk checklists that have been done at this location. This roost is a northern roost that the cranes foraging nearby use rather than flying the 23 miles to Jasper -Pulaski.  Same as gulls use local lakes as roosting locations rather than returning to Lake Michigan after foraging at landfills. One checklist done earlier this year, by this observer, noted that 5,000 cranes were heading to the 600E area. http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S34610409  Another checklist which the observer did found 3,000 SACR flying in a southerly direction to the north of the checklist location  http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S27937963. There are many cranes here.  Three (3) individuals that the observer sppoke with during the week noted they thought there were more cranes here than at Jasper-Pulaski. If you look at a map the area available to them is larger at this location. Recommend changing the filter to 20,000 as it is for Jackson and Green Counties. LaPorte County is an adjacent county to Jasper-Pulaski and the SACR are only going to continue increasing.",Antigone canadensis,sancra,Species,5643,,4.33,3,,1422,1828

Judging by size, two appeared to be males, three females. One presumed male was calling frequently. Considering successful nesting/fledging of two offspring in the general area in 2019 (unknown until recently), 2021, and 2022, we speculated about the origin of these birds and whether they may have born in somewhere in this southeast-Quabbin region. It takes 2-3 years for immature birds to acquire adult plumage. These are not any of the two adults with recently fledged young reported more than 2 weeks ago.

There were many contact calls going on, most likely because one of the young birds flew off-course and didn't re-join the other three for a couple of minutes. Instead of joining the family on the grass, the independent colt flew  straight into the marsh where the foursome generally feeds until sunset. The others followed it in.

Fairly consistent counts until the cold weather hit.  Believe numbers dropped the last two days due to the colder weather causing migration.    FHC Counted cranes on the ground and those coming from @ 417 PM - 450 PM.   10,980 on the ground  + 6,370 in flight &#61; 17,350 cranes  S 600E in field on east side south of pond- 2600 birds @ 1440 PM Upon looking these did not take flight en masse to move to the roosting area immediately to the north before 445 PM. The area they were thickest in was immediately to the south of it.  There were an additional 700 birds seen on the east side of S 600E, north of the east pond at 445 PM however.  E 1125S, east of S 600E  -  1060 birds @ 1510 PM 1030 on the south side and 30 on the north Didn't check it at dusk.  E 1100N, west of S 600E, near the low spot - 1320 birds @ 1535 PM Not as many as there were two (2) days ago.  E 1000S, north side, west of S 550E - 5,000 birds @ 1600 PM There were none on the east half of this field as there had been two (2) days ago. These were counted by scope and many were missed due to some being out of sight in low spots and behind vegetation from the best viewing location. Since only about half of the surface area previously covered by the birds two days ago was now covered that estimate of 7,000 birds was most likely low.  This flock took off all at the same time while I was there starting with the birds at the far west end and flew across the road and settled on the east side of S 500E which was the typical staging area that I recall from the past. None settled in the marsh on the south side of E 1000S, but all settled on the ag land on the west side of it.  S 500E, east side, south of E 1000S - 1000 birds @ 1550 PM  S 550E, east side low spot - zero (0) birds at 215 PM CST and didn't see any there just after dusk. Some were seen settling there at @ 445 PM CST but it was too dark to count. These birds were coming from the north.  Birds Flying in from 1615 PM to 1650 PM  - 6,370 birds 4,070 + 2300  Sat on S 500E and counted birds periodically, about every three minutes, as they came in. From 417 PM to 434 PM I had a total of 2,440 birds in 6 counts spaced 3 minutes apart. Birds seen in flight were 300, 600, 220, 600, 190, and 530. Averaging the total birds by the six counts gives 407 birds per minute. Multiplying this rate by the time watched of 20 minutes gives total birds of 8,140. To get amount to use I divided that amount in half, giving 4,070 cranes, which would subtract any of the birds previously seen on the ground to the south (1,060 + 1,320 &#61; 2,380 birds) plus an additional 1,690 birds to avoid overcounting.  More birds continued to come in after 437 PM until the time I left, with more coming in yet. Had @ 125 birds minute by averaging. Time would be 23 minutes from 437-500PM and used 100 birds per min for 2300 birds. Cranes were still coming in from the north when I left.",Antigone canadensis,sancra,Species,5643,,5.00,2,,2448,3264

The birds were coming & going continuously, with large concentrations settling into areas W and SW of the golf course.  We had great looks at the birds from the brush dump near the western end of Fairway Ln.  This is the lane that turns right just past the stucco golf course 'gate' when heading to the lake.  Just before the lake, there are two golf course ponds off to the right.  A small observation platform and parking area are by a short, narrow sandy lane that runs between these ponds and ponds on the opposite side of the lane.

Marantz on 27 October 2021 in the park east of the community center at Lake Tamarisk, Desert Center, Riverside County, California.","Wurster spotted the continuing crane walking around on the open lawns in the park east of Parkview Drive, where it remained for the entire time that we had it under observation.  Typical of young cranes that I have seen, this bird was rather tame, allowing a close approach without ever appearing wary.  After taking some photos and studying this bird carefully, we continued along our route leaving it near where we had found it, and where it had been present for several days.  I never heard this bird vocalize, and we never saw it fly, or even to spread its wings. This was a large wading bird that appeared superficially like a Great Blue Heron, yet with obvious structural and plumage differences to go along with the fact that it was waling around an open, grassy field.  The bill tapered from a base of medium depth to a pointed tip along a culmen that appeared to be perfectly straight, and with the lower edge of the lower mandible equally straight.  Moreover, this bird’s bill was shorter than that of a heron, in that it was only very slightly longer than the head was wide.  Complementing the short bill was a forehead that was sloping, yet notably steeper than that of a heron, and merging with a rounded crown, all on a head that had more mass than that of a heron.  The neck was long and relatively slim, though stouter where it met the body than where it met the small head.  I also did not notice an obvious S-curve to the neck, though I also never saw this bird in flight to see if it retracted its neck.  The body was plump, full-chested, and with a posture that was midway between horizontal and diagonal, and with a hunch-backed appearance.  The rear part of the bird represented a “bustle” that reflected large tertials that curved over the tips of the wings and tail, and given that I never saw the wings spread, I was unable to see either the primary projection or the placement of the wingtips relative to a tail that I likewise never saw clearly.  The legs were long and seemingly stouter than those of a heron, but I failed to notice much detail on the feet. Although this bird was grayish in part, its patterns and coloration were unlike those of a heron.  The forehead, from the base of the upper mandible up to its junction with the crown, was a light gray color that lacked brown or reddish tones, but which extended through the face and the superciliary region.  Contrasting sharply with the gray forehead and supercilium, the crown was a bright cinnamon in color back to the nape, and to a lesser degree down the back of the neck.  Although the face was generally a light to medium-gray in color, this gray blended to whitish on the throat, and the gray also contrasted with a rounded spot of cinnamon on the auriculars that was completely encircled by gray that extended back through the superciliary region before curving down around their rear terminus along the sides of the neck.  I think the foreneck was more grayish than buff, but I am now a little unsure about this, and I am likewise unsure about the precise color of the underparts, which I thought were more brownish than gray, though I cannot now be certain.  The back of the neck was a cinnamon-buff where it met a back of similar coloration, and I further noted narrow, but seemingly well-defined, shaft-streaks that were dusky, if not blackish.  The scapulars had a bold pattern that combined wedge-shaped centers that were slate gray, and with some feather seemingly having even darker lines along the shaft, with bright, cinnamon-rufous edges on both sides to create a bold pattern.  I am not sure I never clearly saw the lesser coverts, but several pairs of what I thought were median coverts visible on the closed wing had a pattern that combined a medium-gray base with a bright, cinnamon-rufous tip and a narrow, but well-defined, stripe of slate-gray that ran along the shaft.  I thought at least some of the greater coverts had a similar pattern, but I had a harder time seeing this.  The enlarged tertials combined both gray and rufous, but I was unsure about the precise pattern on these feathers, and I am not sure I ever clearly saw the remaining remiges, rump, or rectrices. The bill appeared mostly slate-gray at times, but more pinkish in others, but close inspection seemed to suggest that the upper mandible was slate-gray apart from a pinkish cast to the cutting edge, but that the lower mandible was mostly a dull, dusky pink in color.

One was walking on the prairie just south of Pond 2.  One was sitting on the nest at Teal Pond.  Luckily I saw it stand up which revealed two eggs that it had been sitting on.  It bent over and turned the eggs and then sat down on the eggs again to continue the incubation.  I saw the pair of Sandhill Cranes first build the nest on 4 Mar 2024.  They seldom visited the nest after that.  The rain that fell after that date cause the level of the water in Teal Pond to rise considerably.  I thought the cranes would not nest there again because of the high water and wet nest.  I was wrong.  They added a few more cattail leaves and raised the nest a bit higher above the water and now have laid eggs.  In the past two years when they have nest there and laid eggs there the eggs have been predated and destroyed.  Will it happen again this year.

Typical of young cranes that I have seen, this bird was rather tame, allowing a close approach without ever appearing wary.  After taking some photos and studying this bird carefully, we continued along our route leaving it near where we had found it, and where it had been present for several days.  I never heard this bird vocalize, and we never saw it fly, or even to spread its wings. This was a large wading bird that appeared superficially like a Great Blue Heron, yet with obvious structural and plumage differences to go along with the fact that it was waling around an open, grassy field.  The bill tapered from a base of medium depth to a pointed tip along a culmen that appeared to be perfectly straight, and with the lower edge of the lower mandible equally straight.  Moreover, this bird’s bill was shorter than that of a heron, in that it was only very slightly longer than the head was wide.  Complementing the short bill was a forehead that was sloping, yet notably steeper than that of a heron, and merging with a rounded crown, all on a head that had more mass than that of a heron.  The neck was long and relatively slim, though stouter where it met the body than where it met the small head.  I also did not notice an obvious S-curve to the neck, though I also never saw this bird in flight to see if it retracted its neck.  The body was plump, full-chested, and with a posture that was midway between horizontal and diagonal, and with a hunch-backed appearance.  The rear part of the bird represented a “bustle” that reflected large tertials that curved over the tips of the wings and tail, and given that I never saw the wings spread, I was unable to see either the primary projection or the placement of the wingtips relative to a tail that I likewise never saw clearly.  The legs were long and seemingly stouter than those of a heron, but I failed to notice much detail on the feet. Although this bird was grayish in part, its patterns and coloration were unlike those of a heron.  The forehead, from the base of the upper mandible up to its junction with the crown, was a light gray color that lacked brown or reddish tones, but which extended through the face and the superciliary region.  Contrasting sharply with the gray forehead and supercilium, the crown was a bright cinnamon in color back to the nape, and to a lesser degree down the back of the neck.  Although the face was generally a light to medium-gray in color, this gray blended to whitish on the throat, and the gray also contrasted with a rounded spot of cinnamon on the auriculars that was completely encircled by gray that extended back through the superciliary region before curving down around their rear terminus along the sides of the neck.  I think the foreneck was more grayish than buff, but I am now a little unsure about this, and I am likewise unsure about the precise color of the underparts, which I thought were more brownish than gray, though I cannot now be certain.  The back of the neck was a cinnamon-buff where it met a back of similar coloration, and I further noted narrow, but seemingly well-defined, shaft-streaks that were dusky, if not blackish.  The scapulars had a bold pattern that combined wedge-shaped centers that were slate gray, and with some feather seemingly having even darker lines along the shaft, with bright, cinnamon-rufous edges on both sides to create a bold pattern.  I am not sure I never clearly saw the lesser coverts, but several pairs of what I thought were median coverts visible on the closed wing had a pattern that combined a medium-gray base with a bright, cinnamon-rufous tip and a narrow, but well-defined, stripe of slate-gray that ran along the shaft.  I thought at least some of the greater coverts had a similar pattern, but I had a harder time seeing this.  The enlarged tertials combined both gray and rufous, but I was unsure about the precise pattern on these feathers, and I am not sure I ever clearly saw the remaining remiges, rump, or rectrices. The bill appeared mostly slate-gray at times, but more pinkish in others, but close inspection seemed to suggest that the upper mandible was slate-gray apart from a pinkish cast to the cutting edge, but that the lower mandible was mostly a dull, dusky pink in color.  The irides appeared to be an odd shade of olive-brown, and surrounding the eye was a narrow orbital-ring that was yellow in color.  Finally, the legs and toes were slate-gray in color, but I managed to overlook the precise color of the claws, though I thought they were dark.",Antigone canadensis,sancra,Species,5643,,4.50,2,,2889,4572

I was preparing lunch and looked out the window when I saw a Sandhill Crane at close range slowly striding through my backyard. It walked slowly but steadily uphill and across the street to a neighbor’s yard where I was able to get photos from my front porch. It walked in front of their house then up their driveway between cars and behind their house, continuing steadily up the hill through the neighborhood. It was panting heavily in the heat and giving quiet croaks. Maybe the same bird that was hanging out at Arby’s in Marietta back on August 1st?  I also had a lost midsummer crane in Bartow Co. 2 years ago (Taff Rd., July 26, 2017).   We get plenty of flyovers during migration, but never expected it as an actual “yard” bird, much less in mid August!",Antigone canadensis,sancra,Species,5643,,4.50,2,,2400,3200

LaPorte County is an adjacent county to Jasper-Pulaski and the SACR are only going to continue increasing.   Although this count of 7,360 is just an on-ground count with no dusk flight count the SACR on ground numbers dropped in the past two daily readings from the on-ground high of 13,900 on 11.29.17 and also from 12,480 on 12.04.17, just four (4) days ago. Excluding the first count the mean on-ground count from 11.29.17 through 12.06.17 was 11,081. The drop in the on-ground count is associated with the drop in the temperature, as would be expected. The temperature dropped down to 13.5 F at 0515 at the LaPorte Municipal Airport, and down to 12.6 F at Kingsford Heights  this AM. Although in speaking with the man that plows the local roads some do remain around during the winter as he stated that they would be out in the road when he was plowing.   Surveyed this area intensively for @ one week. Had 10,400 on 11.26.17; 14,900 on 11.29; and 17,350 on 12.01; 15,605 on 12.02.17; 16,803 on 12.03.17; 17,080 on 12.04.17, 11,100 on 12.06.17; and 7,360 on 12.08.17 ( which did not include the dusk flight count.). Fairly consistent counts until the cold weather hit.  Believe numbers dropped the last two days due to the colder weather causing migration.  17,000 previously reported for LaPorte Co in March of 2015 http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S22388042 without any supporting documentation   and the SACR population is experiencing an increase. Not this many were here two (2) years ago. Many other local checklists by several observers from earlier this year showing 5,000-8,000 SACR @ 5 miles to the SW of this roosting location. It is 23 miles to Jasper-Pulaski.  This observation was continued until dusk to include the SACR flying in to roost as observer had knowledge and experience of seeing large flocks nearby earlier this year. There are no other dusk checklists that have been done at this location. This roost is a northern roost that the cranes foraging nearby use rather than flying the 23 miles to Jasper -Pulaski.  Same as gulls use local lakes as roosting locations rather than returning to Lake Michigan after foraging at landfills. One checklist done earlier this year, by this observer, noted that 5,000 cranes were heading to the 600E area. http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S34610409  Another checklist which the observer did found 3,000 SACR flying in a southerly direction to the north of the checklist location  http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S27937963. There are many cranes here.  Three (3) individuals that the observer sppoke with during the week noted they thought there were more cranes here than at Jasper-Pulaski. If you look at a map the area available to them is larger at this location. Recommend changing the filter to 20,000 as it is for Jackson and Green Counties.

Averaging the total birds by the six counts gives 407 birds per minute. Multiplying this rate by the time watched of 20 minutes gives total birds of 8,140. To get amount to use I divided that amount in half, giving 4,070 cranes, which would subtract any of the birds previously seen on the ground to the south (1,060 + 1,320 &#61; 2,380 birds) plus an additional 1,690 birds to avoid overcounting.  More birds continued to come in after 437 PM until the time I left, with more coming in yet. Had @ 125 birds minute by averaging. Time would be 23 minutes from 437-500PM and used 100 birds per min for 2300 birds.

LaPorte County is an adjacent county to Jasper-Pulaski and the SACR are only going to continue increasing.   12.14.17  Still no action on this checklist or these http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S40832917   and http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S40852067.  10700 previously approved for a 11.26.17 checklist at this same location.  17000 previously approved at location @ eight (8) miles to the SW in 2015  http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S22388042 with no supporting documentation and SACR numbers are increasing.  Filter should be set to 20,000 as in Jackson and Greene Counties.  Surveyed this area intensively for @ one week. Had 10,400 on 11.26.17; 14,900 on 11.29; and 17,350 on 12.01; 15,605 on 12.02.17; 16,803 on 12.03.17; 17,080 on 12.04.17, 11,100 on 12.06.17; and 7,360 on 12.08.17 ( which did not include the dusk flight count.). Fairly consistent counts until the cold weather hit.  Believe numbers dropped the last two days due to the colder weather causing migration.    FHC Counted cranes on the ground and those coming from @ 417 PM - 450 PM.   10,980 on the ground  + 6,370 in flight &#61; 17,350 cranes  S 600E in field on east side south of pond- 2600 birds @ 1440 PM Upon looking these did not take flight en masse to move to the roosting area immediately to the north before 445 PM. The area they were thickest in was immediately to the south of it.  There were an additional 700 birds seen on the east side of S 600E, north of the east pond at 445 PM however.  E 1125S, east of S 600E  -  1060 birds @ 1510 PM 1030 on the south side and 30 on the north Didn't check it at dusk.  E 1100N, west of S 600E, near the low spot - 1320 birds @ 1535 PM Not as many as there were two (2) days ago.  E 1000S, north side, west of S 550E - 5,000 birds @ 1600 PM There were none on the east half of this field as there had been two (2) days ago. These were counted by scope and many were missed due to some being out of sight in low spots and behind vegetation from the best viewing location. Since only about half of the surface area previously covered by the birds two days ago was now covered that estimate of 7,000 birds was most likely low.  This flock took off all at the same time while I was there starting with the birds at the far west end and flew across the road and settled on the east side of S 500E which was the typical staging area that I recall from the past. None settled in the marsh on the south side of E 1000S, but all settled on the ag land on the west side of it.  S 500E, east side, south of E 1000S - 1000 birds @ 1550 PM  S 550E, east side low spot - zero (0) birds at 215 PM CST and didn't see any there just after dusk. Some were seen settling there at @ 445 PM CST but it was too dark to count. These birds were coming from the north.  Birds Flying in from 1615 PM to 1650 PM  - 6,370 birds 4,070 + 2300  Sat on S 500E and counted birds periodically, about every three minutes, as they came in. From 417 PM to 434 PM I had a total of 2,440 birds in 6 counts spaced 3 minutes apart. Birds seen in flight were 300, 600, 220, 600, 190, and 530.
