A few other birders saw this bird during its time in the southwest corner of the southern Pines area (i.e. nobody saw the bird outside of this fairly small section of the Pines).",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,4.00,6,,1917,2682

At least 8-10 birds visible throughout the count period, within a 20 m radius. Seen actively feeding on Ponderosa Pine cones on the ground and on horizontal Aspen and Ponderosa limbs. Noted birds flying to perches carrying cones in their bills; using their bills to turn a cone apparently to a side not yet probed; and typically making loud wing flaps when taking off. At one point I heard one nutcracker make a rapid series of at least 4 rough ""krah"" calls, and all the birds on the ground immediately flew up. Within less than 30 seconds several had flown back down - I suspected that the call functioned as an alarm, but was apparently a false alarm. Later, I observed 1 nutcracker fly in to where another had been working on a cone for several minutes and displace the sedentary bird. The displaced bird perched on an Aspen limb 1-2 m higher and made a loud downslurred ""peeur"" call several times. The displacer poked halfheartedly at the cone, then moved on, leaving it propped in a fork of the horizontal Aspen branch. I did not observe any caching behavior, though there was definitely some movement of birds to and from the aspen grove. I got some excellent videos of birds feeding on cones. Review of some of the footage shows the birds using their feet to manipulate and hold a cone while stabbing at it with their bill, using an outward prying motion to open cone scales. In some of the footage, birds are seen consuming several seeds, one at a time. Were they perhaps filling their sublingual pouch, then departing to cache seeds elsewhere?",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,4.33,3,,3453,4321

At least 8-10 birds visible throughout the count period, within a 20 m radius. Seen actively feeding on Ponderosa Pine cones on the ground and on horizontal Aspen and Ponderosa limbs. Noted birds flying to perches carrying cones in their bills; using their bills to turn a cone apparently to a side not yet probed; and typically making loud wing flaps when taking off. At one point I heard one nutcracker make a rapid series of at least 4 rough ""krah"" calls, and all the birds on the ground immediately flew up. Within less than 30 seconds several had flown back down - I suspected that the call functioned as an alarm, but was apparently a false alarm. Later, I observed 1 nutcracker fly in to where another had been working on a cone for several minutes and displace the sedentary bird. The displaced bird perched on an Aspen limb 1-2 m higher and made a loud downslurred ""peeur"" call several times. The displacer poked halfheartedly at the cone, then moved on, leaving it propped in a fork of the horizontal Aspen branch. I did not observe any caching behavior, though there was definitely some movement of birds to and from the aspen grove. I got some excellent videos of birds feeding on cones. Review of some of the footage shows the birds using their feet to manipulate and hold a cone while stabbing at it with their bill, using an outward prying motion to open cone scales. In some of the footage, birds are seen consuming several seeds, one at a time. Were they perhaps filling their sublingual pouch, then departing to cache seeds elsewhere?",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,5.00,2,,3456,4608

Those of us waiting at that spot encountered them singly as they flew in, but all 3 ended up high in a Monterey Pine at Greenwood Way and Greenwood Rise. Here the 3 nutcrackers were quiet and elusive, seemingly disappearing into the pine fronds, and eventually we saw they were pulling pine nuts out of pine-cones. One would occasionally fly to another tree for a time, but ended up at the favored pine again.

My research project studied the foraging behavior and spatial cognition in nutcrackers that frequented the areas along Rim Drive, where much human-food supplementation occurs.  I then compared the foraging behavior to what I observed in nutcrackers that lived in several areas within the park far from Rim Drive.  To conduct this study, I caught nutcrackers in walk-in traps and applied unique combinations of color bands to their legs so I could identify them again in the wild.  I found that nutcrackers that lived far from the human-food supplemented areas along Rim Drive cached more food in comparison to those nutcrackers that were seen at Rim Drive.

At least 8-10 birds visible throughout the count period, within a 20 m radius. Seen actively feeding on Ponderosa Pine cones on the ground and on horizontal Aspen and Ponderosa limbs. Noted birds flying to perches carrying cones in their bills; using their bills to turn a cone apparently to a side not yet probed; and typically making loud wing flaps when taking off. At one point I heard one nutcracker make a rapid series of at least 4 rough ""krah"" calls, and all the birds on the ground immediately flew up. Within less than 30 seconds several had flown back down - I suspected that the call functioned as an alarm, but was apparently a false alarm. Later, I observed 1 nutcracker fly in to where another had been working on a cone for several minutes and displace the sedentary bird. The displaced bird perched on an Aspen limb 1-2 m higher and made a loud downslurred ""peeur"" call several times. The displacer poked halfheartedly at the cone, then moved on, leaving it propped in a fork of the horizontal Aspen branch. I did not observe any caching behavior, though there was definitely some movement of birds to and from the aspen grove. I got some excellent videos of birds feeding on cones. Review of some of the footage shows the birds using their feet to manipulate and hold a cone while stabbing at it with their bill, using an outward prying motion to open cone scales.

Those two birds were caught and banded in June, and we use those color bands to tell individuals apart.  I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington studying environmental influences on learning in birds.  Crater Lake National Park funded me to color band some Nutcrackers around the rim and in lower human-use areas to compare behavior and learning ability.  It's possible that the mass amount of exposure to humans (and feeding) that the birds around the rim experience has changed their natural behavior and ability to learn.

Typical flight behavior of pulling its wings fully into body during its undulating flight.  Found in southwest corner of IBSP South Unit's South Pines.","Found around 8:45 am in southwest corner of Pine lot, when I had rested and then looked up hoping to see something wonderfully in the creation and lo and behold, a bird began making an awful crow-like, loud, guttural song and then flew in (see photos). It was a Clark's Nutcracker! This bird was present until Nov 7th and a few other birders saw it during those intervening dates.  All legit sightings were of this bird in the southwest corner of Pines (i.e. report of the bird at the Dead River was a misidentification, as someone was watching it in the south Pines section at that time).  See eBird Nov 6th report for better photos of bird.  Only the 6th Illinois report (but 3 have no documentation and are likely incorrect).  This is only the 3rd record for Illinois, only the 2nd one in the last century (the 9 Oct 1894 Evanston Lighthouse record being the 1st record).  This is the 1st one photographed in Illinois.  Out west in the Rockies, there were a number of reports of Clark's Nutcracker's being seen outside of the mountains and there usual range, so it was a form of an irruption year for them, thus helping increase the chances of this one showing up here along Lake Michigan.  The original IBET post from that morning was, ""I was out birding this morning in a pine lot in northeast Lake County and hadn't come up with anything unusual all morning, so I literally stretched my hands out and asked the Creator God to ""reveal His creation to me"", which meant to me to come across something alittle different and unexpected. Within a minute of that, I began to hear a bird that sounded almost like a Raven's gutteral call. Knowing that species had recently been seen in this area, I was hoping it would be that bird.  I certainly did find a vagrant of the Corvid family, but it turned out to be a CLARK'S NUTCRACKER! It continued to call for a couple minutes before flying over to another Pine after which it soon left. It only was present for about 5 minutes. I was able to secure a number of perched and flight shots of this Nutcracker and I'll post some later today or tomorrow.  I wanted to get this info out there immediately for those who might want to explore for this species. The last direction the bird was heading would take it to Lyons Woods Forest Preserve, which has sufficient habitat to hold it for a few hours. For those who can't make it up here, it's worth mentioned that Wilmette's Gillson Park has some great habitat where it might pass through. Also, Evanston's Northwestern Landfill has pines, although not as old or as tall as Gillson's. There's already a very old record of this species in that area, so keep an eye out this afternoon and tomorrow morning at those locations.  To help find the bird, listen for a strange call that sounds Raven-like. Also, it exclusively stayed in the tops of the pines while calling.  This is only the 3rd record in Illinois history for this species. The first state record was collected on Oct 9th, 1894 from a location that is now the Evanston Arts Center (between Gillson and Northwestern). There were numerous records in the upper Midwest in the year before and after this sighting, so they must have been moving through the Midwest back then. The 2nd state record was a bird that I believe was in west-central Illinois a few winters ago, coming to a feeder. I think it died and the specimen was collected before the birding community was made aware of it.  This sighing gives a reasonable, albiet fairly low, chance at seein it in IL. I plan on going out to Lyons Woods right now and if I relocate it, I'll post again before 1 pm.  Eric Walters Zion, IL November 03, 2007, 10:40 AM""  Also, see Nov 6th account at https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S50683994, for additional photos of this bird feeding on Pine cone seeds and looking for cached seeds/insects in Austrian Pines.",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,3.67,3,,1611,2255

My research project studied the foraging behavior and spatial cognition in nutcrackers that frequented the areas along Rim Drive, where much human-food supplementation occurs.  I then compared the foraging behavior to what I observed in nutcrackers that lived in several areas within the park far from Rim Drive.  To conduct this study, I caught nutcrackers in walk-in traps and applied unique combinations of color bands to their legs so I could identify them again in the wild.  I found that nutcrackers that lived far from the human-food supplemented areas along Rim Drive cached more food in comparison to those nutcrackers that were seen at Rim Drive.

At least 8-10 birds visible throughout the count period, within a 20 m radius. Seen actively feeding on Ponderosa Pine cones on the ground and on horizontal Aspen and Ponderosa limbs. Noted birds flying to perches carrying cones in their bills; using their bills to turn a cone apparently to a side not yet probed; and typically making loud wing flaps when taking off. At one point I heard one nutcracker make a rapid series of at least 4 rough ""krah"" calls, and all the birds on the ground immediately flew up. Within less than 30 seconds several had flown back down - I suspected that the call functioned as an alarm, but was apparently a false alarm. Later, I observed 1 nutcracker fly in to where another had been working on a cone for several minutes and displace the sedentary bird. The displaced bird perched on an Aspen limb 1-2 m higher and made a loud downslurred ""peeur"" call several times. The displacer poked halfheartedly at the cone, then moved on, leaving it propped in a fork of the horizontal Aspen branch. I did not observe any caching behavior, though there was definitely some movement of birds to and from the aspen grove. I got some excellent videos of birds feeding on cones. Review of some of the footage shows the birds using their feet to manipulate and hold a cone while stabbing at it with their bill, using an outward prying motion to open cone scales. In some of the footage, birds are seen consuming several seeds, one at a time. Were they perhaps filling their sublingual pouch, then departing to cache seeds elsewhere?",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,4.00,2,,3149,4214

Spent 3.5 hrs in the area before we located them on west side of road fork that runs up canyon (northwest, or right, when entering area on road from east) from the reported 'Y' in the road. First seen on ground, then watched them forage about from ground to lower story to ground again, covering maybe 100 yards moving a little further up canyon. Birds were almost totally mute. Only a few quiet call notes expressed over a 30 min watch. Very first rough count was 'at least 7,' but lastly, all bunched up close, went into the lower/mid story of some trees almost at once, giving us a rough count of 14. Then they filtered out from these trees by twos and threes and seemed to just go on and on. Photos to add later.",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,4.00,2,,,

When foraging in the dead pine, the one bird picked at the needle clusters at the tips of the branches.  These birds occasionally gave scratchy, ""caaarr"" calls in addition to a harsh rattle that was not unlike a call by a Steller's Jay.  These birds flew widely about the area, but they also readily perched in the open, often at the very top of a tree.  These were large jays, yet they appeared more like small crows given their more stocky structure.  The bill was almost as long as head was wide, in that it would have extended back beyond the auriculars if reversed on the head.  The culmen was slightly decurved and the bill tapered to a sharply pointed tip.  The forehead was gently sloping and the crown was weakly rounded on a head that appeared quite large in proportion to the body.  The neck was short and inconspicuous, and the body was plump with a posture that approached diagonal when the birds perched atop the trees.  The wings were conspicuously long, with wingtips that reached almost all that way to the tip of the tail, but I failed to note the primary projection precisely, even though I am confident that it was also quite long.  The medium-length tail was about as long as the body without the head, it was parallel-sided, and squared-off at the tip.  The long undertail-coverts further accentuated the short appearance of the tail.  The legs were stout, but of unremarkable length.  These were boldly marked birds given the contrast between the mostly black wings and the light to medium-gray shades of the head, back, and underparts.  The immediate forehead, chin, and the area around the eyes was white, and on one of the birds, a narrow band of white encircled the gray auriculars.  The back and scapulars were unmarked, but the wings were almost entirely black.  I noted that the secondaries were mostly white in the closed wing, but the innermost feathers appeared to be black.  The primaries were entirely black, but the primary coverts on the bird I saw best were brown, as apparently was a feather or two associated with the alula.  The undertail coverts were snow-white, so they contrasted sharply with the gray belly along a line that extended straight across the vent.  The spread wings were rounded and conspicuously broad when seen in flight, and they seemed to be mostly black apart from a large, white speculum in the secondaries.  The bill was black, the eyes were conspicuously dark, and when seen in good light, apparently dark brown.  The legs and feet were dull blackish.",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,3.67,3,,1148,1580

At one point I heard one nutcracker make a rapid series of at least 4 rough ""krah"" calls, and all the birds on the ground immediately flew up. Within less than 30 seconds several had flown back down - I suspected that the call functioned as an alarm, but was apparently a false alarm. Later, I observed 1 nutcracker fly in to where another had been working on a cone for several minutes and displace the sedentary bird. The displaced bird perched on an Aspen limb 1-2 m higher and made a loud downslurred ""peeur"" call several times. The displacer poked halfheartedly at the cone, then moved on, leaving it propped in a fork of the horizontal Aspen branch. I did not observe any caching behavior, though there was definitely some movement of birds to and from the aspen grove. I got some excellent videos of birds feeding on cones. Review of some of the footage shows the birds using their feet to manipulate and hold a cone while stabbing at it with their bill, using an outward prying motion to open cone scales.

I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington studying environmental influences on learning in birds.  Crater Lake National Park funded me to color band some Nutcrackers around the rim and in lower human-use areas to compare behavior and learning ability.

Light grey bird with black wings, white outer tail feathers and white secondary wing feathers obvious when flying. First, around 9:10am, we saw one bird fly into huge pine tree about at Nancy C’s first pin (32.88066° N, 116.45433° W), on Big Laguna Trail at intersection with Laguna Campground Trail. It vocalized only once. It worked pine cones for only a minute or so then flew back southwest across the meadow into pines. Checking pines across the meadow and (32.87981° N, 116.45570° W) produced two additional birds, one making several rattling calls. Later, around 1:45pm, we saw two Clark’s Nutcrackers in group of pines isolated on a small hill at 32.87865° N, 116.45954° W, just east of the southern end of Big Laguna Lake.

Those of us waiting at that spot encountered them singly as they flew in, but all 3 ended up high in a Monterey Pine at Greenwood Way and Greenwood Rise. Here the 3 nutcrackers were quiet and elusive, seemingly disappearing into the pine fronds, and eventually we saw they were pulling pine nuts out of pine-cones. One would occasionally fly to another tree for a time, but ended up at the favored pine again. In the hour or so we spent with them, I think they only called 3 times -- a loud, raspy ""kraa-a-a,"" sometimes uttered twice -- but 99% of the time they were quiet and very easily overlooked.""",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,3.50,2,"",1168,1827

First seen on first ascent in early morning flying downslope to the southwest. Later, maybe the same individual hopped slowly but deliberately up towards the trail through the rocky grass, eventually coming within 20 ft of us and other birders. We later got within ten feet of it for great looks off the south slope of the summit. 'The bird knows what he's doing' '""I know I'm pretty, take my photo!'"" The bird then cheerily hopped and flew farther downslope until it was out of sight. We didn't see it for the last 90 minutes of our log. Remarkable that this species is here, far removed from it's normal dry conifer/rocky habitat. Nolan has photos.

At least 8-10 birds visible throughout the count period, within a 20 m radius. Seen actively feeding on Ponderosa Pine cones on the ground and on horizontal Aspen and Ponderosa limbs. Noted birds flying to perches carrying cones in their bills; using their bills to turn a cone apparently to a side not yet probed; and typically making loud wing flaps when taking off. At one point I heard one nutcracker make a rapid series of at least 4 rough ""krah"" calls, and all the birds on the ground immediately flew up. Within less than 30 seconds several had flown back down - I suspected that the call functioned as an alarm, but was apparently a false alarm. Later, I observed 1 nutcracker fly in to where another had been working on a cone for several minutes and displace the sedentary bird. The displaced bird perched on an Aspen limb 1-2 m higher and made a loud downslurred ""peeur"" call several times. The displacer poked halfheartedly at the cone, then moved on, leaving it propped in a fork of the horizontal Aspen branch. I did not observe any caching behavior, though there was definitely some movement of birds to and from the aspen grove. I got some excellent videos of birds feeding on cones. Review of some of the footage shows the birds using their feet to manipulate and hold a cone while stabbing at it with their bill, using an outward prying motion to open cone scales. In some of the footage, birds are seen consuming several seeds, one at a time. Were they perhaps filling their sublingual pouch, then departing to cache seeds elsewhere?",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,3.50,2,,3456,4608

Those two birds were caught and banded in June, and we use those color bands to tell individuals apart.  I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington studying environmental influences on learning in birds.  Crater Lake National Park funded me to color band some Nutcrackers around the rim and in lower human-use areas to compare behavior and learning ability.  It's possible that the mass amount of exposure to humans (and feeding) that the birds around the rim experience has changed their natural behavior and ability to learn.

Relocated at 1000, about 100 yards north of NC post location and about 200 yards north of TH sighting yesterday (so seem to be staying in general area). Spent 3.5 hrs in the area before we located them on west side of road fork that runs up canyon (northwest, or right, when entering area on road from east) from the reported 'Y' in the road. First seen on ground, then watched them forage about from ground to lower story to ground again, covering maybe 100 yards moving a little further up canyon. Birds were almost totally mute. Only a few quiet call notes expressed over a 30 min watch. Very first rough count was 'at least 7,' but lastly, all bunched up close, went into the lower/mid story of some trees almost at once, giving us a rough count of 14. Then they filtered out from these trees by twos and threes and seemed to just go on and on. Photos to add later.",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,3.50,2,,,

When foraging in the dead pine, the one bird picked at the needle clusters at the tips of the branches.  These birds occasionally gave scratchy, ""caaarr"" calls in addition to a harsh rattle that was not unlike a call by a Steller's Jay.  These birds flew widely about the area, but they also readily perched in the open, often at the very top of a tree.  These were large jays, yet they appeared more like small crows given their more stocky structure.  The bill was almost as long as head was wide, in that it would have extended back beyond the auriculars if reversed on the head.  The culmen was slightly decurved and the bill tapered to a sharply pointed tip.  The forehead was gently sloping and the crown was weakly rounded on a head that appeared quite large in proportion to the body.  The neck was short and inconspicuous, and the body was plump with a posture that approached diagonal when the birds perched atop the trees.  The wings were conspicuously long, with wingtips that reached almost all that way to the tip of the tail, but I failed to note the primary projection precisely, even though I am confident that it was also quite long.  The medium-length tail was about as long as the body without the head, it was parallel-sided, and squared-off at the tip.  The long undertail-coverts further accentuated the short appearance of the tail.  The legs were stout, but of unremarkable length.  These were boldly marked birds given the contrast between the mostly black wings and the light to medium-gray shades of the head, back, and underparts.  The immediate forehead, chin, and the area around the eyes was white, and on one of the birds, a narrow band of white encircled the gray auriculars.  The back and scapulars were unmarked, but the wings were almost entirely black.  I noted that the secondaries were mostly white in the closed wing, but the innermost feathers appeared to be black.  The primaries were entirely black, but the primary coverts on the bird I saw best were brown, as apparently was a feather or two associated with the alula.  The undertail coverts were snow-white, so they contrasted sharply with the gray belly along a line that extended straight across the vent.  The spread wings were rounded and conspicuously broad when seen in flight, and they seemed to be mostly black apart from a large, white speculum in the secondaries.

Found in southwest corner of IBSP South Unit's South Pines.","Found around 8:45 am in southwest corner of Pine lot, when I had rested and then looked up hoping to see something wonderfully in the creation and lo and behold, a bird began making an awful crow-like, loud, guttural song and then flew in (see photos). It was a Clark's Nutcracker! This bird was present until Nov 7th and a few other birders saw it during those intervening dates.  All legit sightings were of this bird in the southwest corner of Pines (i.e. report of the bird at the Dead River was a misidentification, as someone was watching it in the south Pines section at that time).  See eBird Nov 6th report for better photos of bird.  Only the 6th Illinois report (but 3 have no documentation and are likely incorrect).  This is only the 3rd record for Illinois, only the 2nd one in the last century (the 9 Oct 1894 Evanston Lighthouse record being the 1st record).  This is the 1st one photographed in Illinois.  Out west in the Rockies, there were a number of reports of Clark's Nutcracker's being seen outside of the mountains and there usual range, so it was a form of an irruption year for them, thus helping increase the chances of this one showing up here along Lake Michigan.  The original IBET post from that morning was, ""I was out birding this morning in a pine lot in northeast Lake County and hadn't come up with anything unusual all morning, so I literally stretched my hands out and asked the Creator God to ""reveal His creation to me"", which meant to me to come across something alittle different and unexpected. Within a minute of that, I began to hear a bird that sounded almost like a Raven's gutteral call. Knowing that species had recently been seen in this area, I was hoping it would be that bird.  I certainly did find a vagrant of the Corvid family, but it turned out to be a CLARK'S NUTCRACKER! It continued to call for a couple minutes before flying over to another Pine after which it soon left. It only was present for about 5 minutes. I was able to secure a number of perched and flight shots of this Nutcracker and I'll post some later today or tomorrow.  I wanted to get this info out there immediately for those who might want to explore for this species. The last direction the bird was heading would take it to Lyons Woods Forest Preserve, which has sufficient habitat to hold it for a few hours. For those who can't make it up here, it's worth mentioned that Wilmette's Gillson Park has some great habitat where it might pass through. Also, Evanston's Northwestern Landfill has pines, although not as old or as tall as Gillson's. There's already a very old record of this species in that area, so keep an eye out this afternoon and tomorrow morning at those locations.  To help find the bird, listen for a strange call that sounds Raven-like. Also, it exclusively stayed in the tops of the pines while calling.  This is only the 3rd record in Illinois history for this species. The first state record was collected on Oct 9th, 1894 from a location that is now the Evanston Arts Center (between Gillson and Northwestern). There were numerous records in the upper Midwest in the year before and after this sighting, so they must have been moving through the Midwest back then. The 2nd state record was a bird that I believe was in west-central Illinois a few winters ago, coming to a feeder. I think it died and the specimen was collected before the birding community was made aware of it.  This sighing gives a reasonable, albiet fairly low, chance at seein it in IL. I plan on going out to Lyons Woods right now and if I relocate it, I'll post again before 1 pm.  Eric Walters Zion, IL November 03, 2007, 10:40 AM""  Also, see Nov 6th account at https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S50683994, for additional photos of this bird feeding on Pine cone seeds and looking for cached seeds/insects in Austrian Pines.",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,3.00,3,,2029,2841

Our first of hopefully many county records this season, which seems to be an irruptive one for this species in California.",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,4.00,1,,2629,3944

This kind of field note indication was long before I became involved with eBird and the request for counting and reporting counts.  My estimate herewith does ""feel"" right to me, but that was over twenty years ago.  Herewith are two photos of this species, one of an individual atop a rock and the other, of an individual (same or not, I cannot feel sure) atop a conifer--plus, addtionally, a highly cropped version of the one of the bird on the rock, in order better to show details of or related to the bird:  (a) In this ""blow up"" one can more easily see its bright-white undertail coverts, which stand out in contrast to the gray of its other body feathers; and (b) can readily see that the bird has been banded (one band on each leg).",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,3.00,2,,1501,1867

Relocated same area today after Bob Shackleford reported it from there yesterday. I believe it spends the night in the magnolia tree on the corner of Sanderson and Fighting Bucks Ave. Around 9 AM it came out of the tree, perched on a high wire and then went to the ground along the fence on the east side of the street along the golf course. Intermittently it popped onto the fence, then back to the ground. Later it flew to the east side of the golf course near a Christian school.

Individual birds were coming and going, caching seeds in locations away from the pines, but the nutcrackers were not generally moving in groups.  The birds were concentrated in the stands of pines, but we were constantly passing many individual birds, often 3-4 in each tree, nearly continuously over the course of several miles.  I estimated 200 from the trailhead to Dollar Lakes, 50 from Dollar Lakes to Lamoille Lake, and 30 from Lamoille Lake back to the trailhead (loop trail, new ground covered).  Certainly, some individuals may have been seen twice, but based on the pattern of movement of individuals (not in groups), the rate of movement (most individuals staying in a tree until their crop was full), the total ground we covered, etc., I think 280 is a good estimate of the number of individuals.  I've spent a lot of time in CLNU habitat and I've never seen the species in density like this.  The number seems remarkable in the database and it was also remarkable to us in the field.

At least 8-10 birds visible throughout the count period, within a 20 m radius. Seen actively feeding on Ponderosa Pine cones on the ground and on horizontal Aspen and Ponderosa limbs. Noted birds flying to perches carrying cones in their bills; using their bills to turn a cone apparently to a side not yet probed; and typically making loud wing flaps when taking off. At one point I heard one nutcracker make a rapid series of at least 4 rough ""krah"" calls, and all the birds on the ground immediately flew up. Within less than 30 seconds several had flown back down - I suspected that the call functioned as an alarm, but was apparently a false alarm. Later, I observed 1 nutcracker fly in to where another had been working on a cone for several minutes and displace the sedentary bird. The displaced bird perched on an Aspen limb 1-2 m higher and made a loud downslurred ""peeur"" call several times. The displacer poked halfheartedly at the cone, then moved on, leaving it propped in a fork of the horizontal Aspen branch. I did not observe any caching behavior, though there was definitely some movement of birds to and from the aspen grove. I got some excellent videos of birds feeding on cones. Review of some of the footage shows the birds using their feet to manipulate and hold a cone while stabbing at it with their bill, using an outward prying motion to open cone scales.

When I finally realized what the group was pointing at, I was right next to the bird, only 5-10 feet away as it foraged on the grass edging the paved trail. After perching on a speed limit sign and a no parking sign, foraging again on the trailside grass, and perching on an overhead electric wire, it eventually moved to the E-Way parking lot side of road. Photos show: grey overall, heavy jet black bill; solid black wings on the standing bird; tail square with pattern from above (visible in flight) broad white laterally (several rectrices) and black centrally, when perched tail white from below. Body larger and much more bulky, wings more black, and bill much heavier than Northern Mockingbird. Spent considerable time foraging on mowed grassy areas. Seen by around 20 or more others in addition to the UW group by the time I left the site at about 10:25am. Very tolerant of people nearby including walking right below it on the hike/bike trail when it was perched on the roadside wires.",Nucifraga columbiana,clanut,Species,21260,,3.00,1,,3648,3633
