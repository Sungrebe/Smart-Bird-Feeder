Legge. Thank you yet again, William! Initially, Alex picked it up in the willows in the south side of Mitchell Rd. (north side of lagoon) near the “Park Parallel” sign across from the Nature Bridge campus. We lost it fairly quickly and could not refind it until awhile later when it almost flew right over us both on Kirkpatrick St. near building T1044. We followed it to the roped off section near the volleyball court here (37.8326834, -122.5347095), where we eventually enjoyed great views as it foraged actively. We were soon joined by others, who all had solid looks at the bird in the same general vicinity.   Superficially, reminiscent of an empid (WIFL), but overall larger, darker uppers, dark head/crown and face, dark tail, and all black bill. Phoebe-type behavior, constantly tail-wagging. A really good bird for the county, the first since 2017 and the first chaseable one in over a decade(?).

Legge. Thank you yet again, William! Initially, Alex picked it up in the willows in the south side of Mitchell Rd. (north side of lagoon) near the “Park Parallel” sign across from the Nature Bridge campus. We lost it fairly quickly and could not refind it until awhile later when it almost flew right over us both on Kirkpatrick St. near building T1044. We followed it to the roped off section near the volleyball court here (37.8326834, -122.5347095), where we eventually enjoyed great views as it foraged actively. We were soon joined by others, who all had solid looks at the bird in the same general vicinity.   Superficially, reminiscent of an empid (WIFL), but overall larger, darker uppers, dark head/crown and face, dark tail, and all black bill. Phoebe-type behavior, constantly tail-wagging. A really good bird for the county, the first since 2017 and the first chaseable one in over a decade(?). Enjoyed an absolutely lovely Marin Phoebe trifecta.",Sayornis phoebe,easpho,Species,16840,,4.70,10,,1688,2532

Thanks to Tom W. for pointing me in the right direction. Watched the bird for over 30 minutes. It spent most of the time on the fence, but would occasionally fly down to the ground to get a snack. It was continually flicking its tail. During the time I watched the Eastern phoebe was chased off its perch four times by an aggressive Say's phoebe. Three times the Eastern phoebe would fly into the nearby trees, but would shortly return to the fence. Toward the end of my visit, the phoebe was vocalizing almost continually, just a soft 'chip' every second or so.",Sayornis phoebe,easpho,Species,16840,,5.00,3,,2592,4608

We soon realized that it was an Eastern Phoebe and then spent a short time observing this bird and taking photos as it moved about structures along the shore, the stalks of a small stand of bulrushes, the shoreline, and a few nearby trees.  I did not think I ever heard this bird call, but I did hear a Black Phoebe calling nearby.  This bird typically perched low and in the open between its flights so it was easily observed, but it did not permit an overly close approach.  I think I saw this bird dip its tail a few times, but it did not do this extensively. This was a small to medium-sized flycatcher that was typical of a phoebe in its size and structure.  The bill was slim and relatively short, in that it would have extended backward on the face to a point just behind the eye.  The head was unremarkable size with a sloping forehead, a gently rounded crown, and seemingly a weakly peaked appearance to the rear part of the crown.  The neck was short and inconspicuous, and the body was relatively plump, full-chested, and with an upright posture.  The wings were relatively short, with a primary projection that was about one-third the length of the exposed secondaries and the wingtips reaching to the tips of the uppertail coverts.  I counted the tips of five primaries exposed  beyond the longest secondary in the rounded wingtip.  The tail was almost as long as the head and body combined, it was slightly flared, and with a weakly notched tip.  I further thought the rectrices visible from below that pointed tips.  The legs were short and of unremarkable mass. This was a subtly marked bird with relatively dull patterns.  The head was dark, but I am now less sure about the precise color.  If pressed, I would have thought the head was dark brownish, possibly with a grayish or olive cast and with the face appearing more sooty in coloration.  I noted no suggestion of either an eyeing or supercilium.  The solidly dark coloration of the face appeared to extend down to the lower edge of the moustachial and auricular regions, but below this the submoustachial region was clouded darker, which resulted in some degree of blending between the dark face and the cream-colored throat.  The creamy-whitish color of the throat contrasted with a dusky wash at the sides of the breast and foreflanks that nearly pinched off the pale color in the center, below which the belly, rear flanks, and undertail coverts were a pale yellow in color.  I think the underside of the tail was uniformly dark, but I did not see it all that well.  The back and sides of the neck were dusky in coloration, but the back and scapulars were a medium, grayish-olive in color and without pattern.  The wings contrasted as darker than the back given sooty centers to the coverts and remiges.  The greater and median coverts were each fringed with a light, olive-gray color that produced a scaly upper wingbar and a more diffuse lower wingbar that combined a narrow edge and a somewhat broader tip to each feather.  The remiges were also edges paler.  I thought the innermost secondaries had well-defined edges of white, but the edges on the remaining feathers were more grayish to yellowish-olive and seemingly narrower and less conspicuous.  I cannot now recall if the edges were less conspicuous on the primaries and I have no recollection about seeing the primary coverts.  The exposed primary tips were sooty to blackish I color and without conspicuous fringing.  I am not sure I ever saw the rump or uppertail coverts, but the upperside of the tail was sooty in coloration and without obvious fringes. The bill, legs, and feet appeared to be entirely black.  The eyes, were dark, but I was unable to discern any color.",Sayornis phoebe,easpho,Species,16840,,4.67,3,,1563,2390

Then we refound the EAPH sitting on the fence and watched it chip (#2 recording). Shortly after, it was heard only chipping again (#3 recording). At the time I only heard one BLPH before discovering the EAPH and it was farther away in a different direction.

Then we refound the EAPH sitting on the fence and watched it chip (#2 recording). Shortly after, it was heard only chipping again (#3 recording). At the time I only heard one BLPH before discovering the EAPH and it was farther away in a different direction.

Refound today in the previously reported location, on the path near the picnic table near the Grangers’ Wharf parking lot. Around here: (38.020602, -122.142031). Actively flycatching in this area for the half-hour-plus that I observed it. It moved around the general area, ranging from the path to the trees and shrubs to the fence. This bird was a typical phoebe, a large flycatcher constantly pumping its tail. The Eastern was slightly larger than the Black Phoebes in the area, but significantly smaller than the Say’s. It had a dark head which significantly contrasted with its white throat. The white throat wrapped slightly around in the back, reminding me of a classic Myrtle Warbler auricular wrap. The underparts were white with a slight gray-brown vested appearance, and a yellow wash on the belly. The wings, back and tail were all a mostly even gray-brown. Two faint wingbars were visible on a slightly darker-brown wing. I have never seen an Eastern Phoebe before, but from what I can tell this is a rather bright individual. The bird was silent the whole time I observed it, even when local Black Phoebes were actively calling. Photos, and a lifer!!",Sayornis phoebe,easpho,Species,16840,,4.00,4,,1391,1948

One bird was seen on a branch over one of the large ponds and the other was seen on a branch in the middle of the park, probably 100 yards away from water, but not the same pond as the other Phoebe.  The sightings were probably 200-300 yards and over 30 minutes apart.  It is possible it is the same bird as they were very similar in appearance but I am treating them as two separate birds.

Refound today in the previously reported location, on the path near the picnic table near the Grangers’ Wharf parking lot. Around here: (38.020602, -122.142031). Actively flycatching in this area for the half-hour-plus that I observed it. It moved around the general area, ranging from the path to the trees and shrubs to the fence. This bird was a typical phoebe, a large flycatcher constantly pumping its tail. The Eastern was slightly larger than the Black Phoebes in the area, but significantly smaller than the Say’s. It had a dark head which significantly contrasted with its white throat. The white throat wrapped slightly around in the back, reminding me of a classic Myrtle Warbler auricular wrap. The underparts were white with a slight gray-brown vested appearance, and a yellow wash on the belly. The wings, back and tail were all a mostly even gray-brown. Two faint wingbars were visible on a slightly darker-brown wing. I have never seen an Eastern Phoebe before, but from what I can tell this is a rather bright individual. The bird was silent the whole time I observed it, even when local Black Phoebes were actively calling. Photos, and a lifer!!",Sayornis phoebe,easpho,Species,16840,,3.75,4,,1034,1448

This area is signed as City Open Space. The bird's head was darker than the gray-brown back, wings and tail. It was pale below with a whitish throat, had a weak streaky vest, and had a pale yellow belly and undertail coverts. The pale tips of the wing covers created faint wingbars.
