Found by homeowners.  Imm. male Selasphorus hummer with a fair amount of orange on the flanks, rump, tail, and nape, and most remaining green around the back, crown, and shoulders. Showed clean white bib, white throat speckled with rows of dark feathers. Made three stops at the feeder, and visited the flower baskets along the top floor windows along the front of the house, working right to left, and perched several times in a larger apple-ish looking tree with small red fruits. Also perched in a small bare shrub by the white picket fence gate, and twice disappeared into a hemlock in the side yard. Also visited low flowers in front foundation garden. I did not obtain any photos of the spread tail, but Louis Bevier did and confirmed this as a Rufous (as opposed to Allen's) <a href=""https://ebird.org/checklist/S75535127"">Louis's notes here</a> *Called several times while hovering around a perch, a sharp chip reminding me very much of a DEJU. Also acted aggressively towards PISIs, sometimes chasing them away from the feeders. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Derek's notes on viewing the bird:  ""The bird is at 97 Ledgewood Drive in Yarmouth. Ledgewood is a lightly traveled neighborhood road, but it is rather narrow. Please park along one side of the road only (the homeowner’s side/odd numbers) so as not to block traffic. Please be sure not to block any driveways, and avoid turning around in driveways whenever possible. We saw numerous young children out on bikes despite the weather, so please drive very slowly and carefully.  Once at the house, walk to the white picket fence on the RIGHT side of the house. The small hummingbird feeder is on the backside of the bay window. The best line for observations and photographs is several feet to the right of the gate.  Under no circumstances should anyone enter the yard, neighboring yard, or walk in, through, or on any garden beds.  Please include the above instructions in EVERY eBird or any other post...We cannot let people show up with only a GPS location or address and assume they’ll figure out where to see the feeder or where not to be a bother.""",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.65,20,,2568,4441

Behaviorally this hummingbird would perch at a prominent location just outside the feeding area and watch for ""intruding"" hummingbirds - swiftly chasing any away. At regular intervals it would hover over the feeding area looking down and around, moving from viewing spot to viewing spot then after a short while return to its watch perch. It did this over and over and over again, viewing from the same points in the air, and then every few rounds work in some feeding time, too. Interesting behavior, I have not seen any ruby-throats patrol like that. As for physical ID, I am not familiar with either rufous or Allen's hummingbirds. I've included 2 shots where the tail feathers are in a partial spread. I see in Sibley's the two outer tail feathers of an Allen's are narrower than the others; here the two outer feathers look proportionately the same width as the third feather in both shots.

Seen about three times between about 8:45 and 9:00 AM, the  first two times mostly the underside of the tail and vent area, as the bird was perched on the opposite side of a feeder. Also seen by the homeowner during the first few minutes perched in its favorite tree, but I could not see it there. Possibly shot by again at about 9:30.  Not banded by Bruce Peterjohn, but from his review of the photos, he thought this was a Rufous Hummingbird, based on the relatively broad outer tail feathers, and because ""the second rectrix (R2) appears to have a slight but noticeable emargination that would indicate it is a Rufous Hummingbird."" He also stated that ""The bird is clearly a female based on the green central rectrices, but I would not want to speculate on its age based on the tail pattern. Young females tend to have slightly broader outer rectrices than adults, but there is considerable overlap and any differences are measured in tenths of millimeters that would be difficult to judge based solely on photos.""

Homeowner reports the bird has been present for roughly 2 weeks. An immature male/adult female Selasphorus hummingbird, with rufous flanks, a green back, and a patch of red gorget feathers. At the time of observation, we were unable to obtain spread tail photos, but many photos were taken of the bird.  Upon review of photos taken this morning by Matt Misewicz, the spread tail seems to show wide outer retrices suggesting this bird is a Rufous, rather than an Allen's Hummingbird. I feel comfortable counting it as such - unless the bird ends up getting banded and new information regarding it's ID arises.  Homeowners are alright with people viewing the hummingbird, please park on the street and view from the sidewalk unless invited up.

Behaviorally this hummingbird would perch at a prominent location just outside the feeding area and watch for ""intruding"" hummingbirds - swiftly chasing any away. At regular intervals it would hover over the feeding area looking down and around, moving from viewing spot to viewing spot then after a short while return to its watch perch. It did this over and over and over again, viewing from the same points in the air, and then every few rounds work in some feeding time, too. Interesting behavior, I have not seen any ruby-throats patrol like that. As for physical ID, I am not familiar with either rufous or Allen's hummingbirds. I've included 2 shots where the tail feathers are in a partial spread. I see in Sibley's the two outer tail feathers of an Allen's are narrower than the others; here the two outer feathers look proportionately the same width as the third feather in both shots.

Goal was to trap/band/measure fifth rectrix tail feather and rule out Allen's Hummingbird. The hummingbird was not successfully trapped, despite ""herculean"" efforts by Bob Yunick (bander), ""Dillon"" (assistant bander from Albany Pine Bush preserve), and the homeowner. Bob was able to view the hummingbird for approximately five hours, and was able to view my documentary photos of the fan/spread tail feathers, and gorget photos. Based on five hours of viewing/ seeing behavior/ and looking at my photos, Bob Yunick believes this hummingbird to be a hatch year female Rufous Hummingbird. Bob was able to view my tail fan/ spread photos and the fifth rectrix tail feather does not seem to have the narrow fifth rectrix. The shape of tail feathers did not indicate Allen's. There were no identifiable characteristics to indicate Allen's. Bob used Peterson's Hummingbird Guide of North America by Sheri L. Williamson and compared the plates to my 8/9/22 photos (see my ebird report-same date to see some of the same photos I showed Bob). The photos did not match perfectly to any of the plates, although it more aligned with Rufous Hummingbird. Although Bob could not view hummingbird in hand (to see two line striation in bill indicating juvenile), his views and hummingbird's behavior indicated likely juvenile. Re: ""herculean"" efforts to trap hummingbird: Homeowner doesn't have a hummingbird feeder, thus the hummingbird has been feeding on flowers. Bob's trapping system is a hummingbird feeder in a net surround. The net is lifted half way up the feeder, and has a long attached line to where Bob is seated. In cases where a hummingbird is familiar to a feeder, once hummingbird enters the net surround and starts to feed, Bob would be able to release line and net would drop before hummingbird could escape net surround. This hummingbird was not familiar with the feeder and took many steps to feed anywhere and everywhere except the feeder. *For five hours!*.  Bob, his assistant , the homeowner and I came up with many revised steps. The hummingbird feeder was decorated with the hummingbird's favorite flowers, the inside of the net surround contained its favorite flowers.  A large/ heavy planter with its favorite flowers was moved underneath the net surround. The hummingbird fed on all the flowers except the ones near the feeder. The hummingbird started to feed near the planted flowers, and the homeowner covered the favored planted flowers with bed sheets. The hummingbird would feed on the flowers below the sheet, and tried to fly up under the sheet. Then, the hummingbird fed elsewhere in the garden, and the assistant and I sat at the two other planted areas that the hummingbird started feeding, in hopes that seeing us so close to the other planted areas may thwart the hummingbird and send it back to the feeder area. That helped somewhat, but the hummingbird only came close to going inside the net area once (in five hours), but hummingbird was hesitant and hovering closer to the net.  It would have escaped when Bob let net down, and then the hummingbird would be frightened and not return.  The bander left, and then the Ruby-throated Hummingbird landed on a branch in a nearby tree. The Rufous Hummingbird flew in and perched four inches away from the Ruby-throated(!) (that had been dive bombing it). This is not territorial adult behavior. New goal: homeowner is going to set up hummingbird feeder in yard, hoping that this hummingbird will observe local Ruby-throated hummingbirds (there seems to be some territorial disputes between the Ruby-throated and Rufous) and get familiar with the feeder (over a period of days).  And then perhaps then try banding again.  That's *if* hummingbird stays around, and *if* after discussing with bander he feels there may be success in trapping, and he has availability.  This location is private and homeowner hasn't opened location to the birding public. I have included my long notation here, as I have had many messages asking me for this information. I did not take out my camera to use, until after the bander left.  He hasn't seen photos attached to today's report. Photos continue to show tail fan/spread, which also make Rufous Hummingbird seem more likely. Edit: I want to mention that the Ruby-throated Hummingbird was enticed by feeder set-up and was trapped and banded by Bob.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,5.00,6,,3272,4090

Behaviorally this hummingbird would perch at a prominent location just outside the feeding area and watch for ""intruding"" hummingbirds - swiftly chasing any away. At regular intervals it would hover over the feeding area looking down and around, moving from viewing spot to viewing spot then after a short while return to its watch perch. It did this over and over and over again, viewing from the same points in the air, and then every few rounds work in some feeding time, too. Interesting behavior, I have not seen any ruby-throats patrol like that. As for physical ID, I am not familiar with either rufous or Allen's hummingbirds. I've included 2 shots where the tail feathers are in a partial spread. I see in Sibley's the two outer tail feathers of an Allen's are narrower than the others; here the two outer feathers look proportionately the same width as the third feather in both shots.

Found by homeowners.  Imm. male Selasphorus hummer with a fair amount of orange on the flanks, rump, tail, and nape, and most remaining green around the back, crown, and shoulders. Showed clean white bib, white throat speckled with rows of dark feathers. Made three stops at the feeder, and visited the flower baskets along the top floor windows along the front of the house, working right to left, and perched several times in a larger apple-ish looking tree with small red fruits. Also perched in a small bare shrub by the white picket fence gate, and twice disappeared into a hemlock in the side yard. Also visited low flowers in front foundation garden. I did not obtain any photos of the spread tail, but Louis Bevier did and confirmed this as a Rufous (as opposed to Allen's) <a href=""https://ebird.org/checklist/S75535127"">Louis's notes here</a> *Called several times while hovering around a perch, a sharp chip reminding me very much of a DEJU. Also acted aggressively towards PISIs, sometimes chasing them away from the feeders. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Derek's notes on viewing the bird:  ""The bird is at 97 Ledgewood Drive in Yarmouth. Ledgewood is a lightly traveled neighborhood road, but it is rather narrow. Please park along one side of the road only (the homeowner’s side/odd numbers) so as not to block traffic. Please be sure not to block any driveways, and avoid turning around in driveways whenever possible. We saw numerous young children out on bikes despite the weather, so please drive very slowly and carefully.  Once at the house, walk to the white picket fence on the RIGHT side of the house. The small hummingbird feeder is on the backside of the bay window. The best line for observations and photographs is several feet to the right of the gate.  Under no circumstances should anyone enter the yard, neighboring yard, or walk in, through, or on any garden beds.  Please include the above instructions in EVERY eBird or any other post...We cannot let people show up with only a GPS location or address and assume they’ll figure out where to see the feeder or where not to be a bother.""",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.27,11,,2767,4608

Only later did we independently realize that all six of these photos represent the same individual. After questioning my initial identification as an adult female Calliope Hummingbird, I reached out for expert review. Sheri Williamson wrote: ""Definitely not Calliope by gorget pattern and dark lore; R5 with no visible rufous and extensive green on undertail coverts suggestive of Anna's × Rufous."" Apparently, though, the large amount of green on the tail and the undertail coverts is at the edge of variation for Rufous. Sheri followed by noting that ""normal-length greater secondary coverts"" rule out this being a hybrid.

Goal was to trap/band/measure fifth rectrix tail feather and rule out Allen's Hummingbird. The hummingbird was not successfully trapped, despite ""herculean"" efforts by Bob Yunick (bander), ""Dillon"" (assistant bander from Albany Pine Bush preserve), and the homeowner. Bob was able to view the hummingbird for approximately five hours, and was able to view my documentary photos of the fan/spread tail feathers, and gorget photos. Based on five hours of viewing/ seeing behavior/ and looking at my photos, Bob Yunick believes this hummingbird to be a hatch year female Rufous Hummingbird. Bob was able to view my tail fan/ spread photos and the fifth rectrix tail feather does not seem to have the narrow fifth rectrix. The shape of tail feathers did not indicate Allen's. There were no identifiable characteristics to indicate Allen's. Bob used Peterson's Hummingbird Guide of North America by Sheri L. Williamson and compared the plates to my 8/9/22 photos (see my ebird report-same date to see some of the same photos I showed Bob). The photos did not match perfectly to any of the plates, although it more aligned with Rufous Hummingbird. Although Bob could not view hummingbird in hand (to see two line striation in bill indicating juvenile), his views and hummingbird's behavior indicated likely juvenile. Re: ""herculean"" efforts to trap hummingbird: Homeowner doesn't have a hummingbird feeder, thus the hummingbird has been feeding on flowers. Bob's trapping system is a hummingbird feeder in a net surround. The net is lifted half way up the feeder, and has a long attached line to where Bob is seated. In cases where a hummingbird is familiar to a feeder, once hummingbird enters the net surround and starts to feed, Bob would be able to release line and net would drop before hummingbird could escape net surround. This hummingbird was not familiar with the feeder and took many steps to feed anywhere and everywhere except the feeder. *For five hours!*.  Bob, his assistant , the homeowner and I came up with many revised steps. The hummingbird feeder was decorated with the hummingbird's favorite flowers, the inside of the net surround contained its favorite flowers.  A large/ heavy planter with its favorite flowers was moved underneath the net surround. The hummingbird fed on all the flowers except the ones near the feeder. The hummingbird started to feed near the planted flowers, and the homeowner covered the favored planted flowers with bed sheets. The hummingbird would feed on the flowers below the sheet, and tried to fly up under the sheet. Then, the hummingbird fed elsewhere in the garden, and the assistant and I sat at the two other planted areas that the hummingbird started feeding, in hopes that seeing us so close to the other planted areas may thwart the hummingbird and send it back to the feeder area. That helped somewhat, but the hummingbird only came close to going inside the net area once (in five hours), but hummingbird was hesitant and hovering closer to the net.  It would have escaped when Bob let net down, and then the hummingbird would be frightened and not return.  The bander left, and then the Ruby-throated Hummingbird landed on a branch in a nearby tree. The Rufous Hummingbird flew in and perched four inches away from the Ruby-throated(!) (that had been dive bombing it). This is not territorial adult behavior. New goal: homeowner is going to set up hummingbird feeder in yard, hoping that this hummingbird will observe local Ruby-throated hummingbirds (there seems to be some territorial disputes between the Ruby-throated and Rufous) and get familiar with the feeder (over a period of days).  And then perhaps then try banding again.  That's *if* hummingbird stays around, and *if* after discussing with bander he feels there may be success in trapping, and he has availability.  This location is private and homeowner hasn't opened location to the birding public. I have included my long notation here, as I have had many messages asking me for this information. I did not take out my camera to use, until after the bander left.  He hasn't seen photos attached to today's report. Photos continue to show tail fan/spread, which also make Rufous Hummingbird seem more likely. Edit: I want to mention that the Ruby-throated Hummingbird was enticed by feeder set-up and was trapped and banded by Bob.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,5.00,4,,3240,4050

Green back, rufous at base of tail and flanks. While most experienced observers were comfortable calling this a Rufous rather than an Allen's, attempts to capture the bird for measurements and banding were unsuccessful. ID is based upon comments by Sheri Williamson, director of the Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory, and author of the Peterson Field Guide to Hummingbirds of North America, after she reviewed my photos:  ""It helps that this is a juvenile male, which tend to be easier to pin down than juvenile females. The back view is particularly informative in that it shows a) the outer tail feathers (R5) without the foreshortening that makes the front view confusing and b) a broad R2 with a ""pinched"" tip. Not all juvenile male Rufous have a distinctly ""pinched"" R2, and occasional Allen's will show a very slight ""pinch"" farther from the tip on a narrower, more sharply tapered R2, but this bird's R2 and R5 both fit Rufous.""",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.33,6,,1047,1047

My guess is that this is an immature male, based on some of the throat feathers showing color (see Nov 13th photos of tail and throat).   Since I was leaving town for a couple months, I knew I couldn't leave this feeder up and strand the bird, so with a number of warm days arriving, I took down the feeder at 2:30 pm.  However, the Rufous kept coming back until at least 3:57 pm (sunset was 4:30 pm today).  It kept flying around looking for the feeder, seemingly confused, at times perching in the White Pine or Tiger Lily dead stalk.  Overall, it evoked sadness inside as one wants to care for such a beautiful and rare bird, but I knew if I didn't take the feeder away, it would surely die once the water froze in it.  This bird stayed from Nov 11th-14th.  It's a certainty in my mind that this bird would have followed the pattern of other Rufous Hummingbirds in Northern Illinois.  That is, show up in early November (or perhaps as late as the late Dec CBC's) and then stay at an available hummingbird feeder until about mid-January when they either expire due to extreme weather or they move somewhere else.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.17,6,,572,800

Feeding at various plants around the yard, and hawking insects. Did not visit actual feeder. Plumage features point to adult female (throat pattern, wing molt, etc). The bird's R2 feathers don't appear to be emarginated, but the outer tail feathers are quite broad and rule out Allen's. This is the third RUHU that Brian has hosted in his yard!    Tim Shreckengost, Ian Gardner, and I raced up to Camden-Wyoming to see the bird for ourselves. After a few minutes of waiting and watching in the drizzling rain, the hummer shot in out of nowhere and perched at the top of a bush and looked around. During our visit the hummingbird dashed around the yard many times, often perching rather close for extended views, stretching it’s wings and tail as if to show off and allow us the opportunity to attempt to get a definitive ID of the bird. Based on it’s molt, gorget pattern, and coloration we knew it was an adult female Selasphorus; and either a Rufous or Allen’s. Based on how broad the outer tail feathers are, we feel pretty confident calling this a Rufous Hummingbird.    Thanks again to Brian for letting us invade his home and yard for a few hours the other day! This is actually Brian’s third Rufous Hummingbird in the last three years – clearly going to show how much these winter hummingbirds love backyards with a nice garden and a variety of food sources.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.50,4,,1676,2507

Sheri Williamson wrote: ""Definitely not Calliope by gorget pattern and dark lore; R5 with no visible rufous and extensive green on undertail coverts suggestive of Anna's × Rufous."" Apparently, though, the large amount of green on the tail and the undertail coverts is at the edge of variation for Rufous.

Goal was to trap/band/measure fifth rectrix tail feather and rule out Allen's Hummingbird. The hummingbird was not successfully trapped, despite ""herculean"" efforts by Bob Yunick (bander), ""Dillon"" (assistant bander from Albany Pine Bush preserve), and the homeowner. Bob was able to view the hummingbird for approximately five hours, and was able to view my documentary photos of the fan/spread tail feathers, and gorget photos. Based on five hours of viewing/ seeing behavior/ and looking at my photos, Bob Yunick believes this hummingbird to be a hatch year female Rufous Hummingbird. Bob was able to view my tail fan/ spread photos and the fifth rectrix tail feather does not seem to have the narrow fifth rectrix. The shape of tail feathers did not indicate Allen's. There were no identifiable characteristics to indicate Allen's. Bob used Peterson's Hummingbird Guide of North America by Sheri L. Williamson and compared the plates to my 8/9/22 photos (see my ebird report-same date to see some of the same photos I showed Bob). The photos did not match perfectly to any of the plates, although it more aligned with Rufous Hummingbird. Although Bob could not view hummingbird in hand (to see two line striation in bill indicating juvenile), his views and hummingbird's behavior indicated likely juvenile. Re: ""herculean"" efforts to trap hummingbird: Homeowner doesn't have a hummingbird feeder, thus the hummingbird has been feeding on flowers. Bob's trapping system is a hummingbird feeder in a net surround. The net is lifted half way up the feeder, and has a long attached line to where Bob is seated. In cases where a hummingbird is familiar to a feeder, once hummingbird enters the net surround and starts to feed, Bob would be able to release line and net would drop before hummingbird could escape net surround. This hummingbird was not familiar with the feeder and took many steps to feed anywhere and everywhere except the feeder. *For five hours!*.  Bob, his assistant , the homeowner and I came up with many revised steps. The hummingbird feeder was decorated with the hummingbird's favorite flowers, the inside of the net surround contained its favorite flowers.  A large/ heavy planter with its favorite flowers was moved underneath the net surround. The hummingbird fed on all the flowers except the ones near the feeder. The hummingbird started to feed near the planted flowers, and the homeowner covered the favored planted flowers with bed sheets. The hummingbird would feed on the flowers below the sheet, and tried to fly up under the sheet. Then, the hummingbird fed elsewhere in the garden, and the assistant and I sat at the two other planted areas that the hummingbird started feeding, in hopes that seeing us so close to the other planted areas may thwart the hummingbird and send it back to the feeder area. That helped somewhat, but the hummingbird only came close to going inside the net area once (in five hours), but hummingbird was hesitant and hovering closer to the net.  It would have escaped when Bob let net down, and then the hummingbird would be frightened and not return.  The bander left, and then the Ruby-throated Hummingbird landed on a branch in a nearby tree. The Rufous Hummingbird flew in and perched four inches away from the Ruby-throated(!) (that had been dive bombing it). This is not territorial adult behavior. New goal: homeowner is going to set up hummingbird feeder in yard, hoping that this hummingbird will observe local Ruby-throated hummingbirds (there seems to be some territorial disputes between the Ruby-throated and Rufous) and get familiar with the feeder (over a period of days).  And then perhaps then try banding again.  That's *if* hummingbird stays around, and *if* after discussing with bander he feels there may be success in trapping, and he has availability.  This location is private and homeowner hasn't opened location to the birding public. I have included my long notation here, as I have had many messages asking me for this information. I did not take out my camera to use, until after the bander left.  He hasn't seen photos attached to today's report. Photos continue to show tail fan/spread, which also make Rufous Hummingbird seem more likely. Edit: I want to mention that the Ruby-throated Hummingbird was enticed by feeder set-up and was trapped and banded by Bob.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,5.00,3,,3272,4090

This hummingbird was not familiar with the feeder and took many steps to feed anywhere and everywhere except the feeder. *For five hours!*.  Bob, his assistant , the homeowner and I came up with many revised steps. The hummingbird feeder was decorated with the hummingbird's favorite flowers, the inside of the net surround contained its favorite flowers.  A large/ heavy planter with its favorite flowers was moved underneath the net surround. The hummingbird fed on all the flowers except the ones near the feeder. The hummingbird started to feed near the planted flowers, and the homeowner covered the favored planted flowers with bed sheets. The hummingbird would feed on the flowers below the sheet, and tried to fly up under the sheet. Then, the hummingbird fed elsewhere in the garden, and the assistant and I sat at the two other planted areas that the hummingbird started feeding, in hopes that seeing us so close to the other planted areas may thwart the hummingbird and send it back to the feeder area. That helped somewhat, but the hummingbird only came close to going inside the net area once (in five hours), but hummingbird was hesitant and hovering closer to the net.  It would have escaped when Bob let net down, and then the hummingbird would be frightened and not return.  The bander left, and then the Ruby-throated Hummingbird landed on a branch in a nearby tree. The Rufous Hummingbird flew in and perched four inches away from the Ruby-throated(!) (that had been dive bombing it). This is not territorial adult behavior. New goal: homeowner is going to set up hummingbird feeder in yard, hoping that this hummingbird will observe local Ruby-throated hummingbirds (there seems to be some territorial disputes between the Ruby-throated and Rufous) and get familiar with the feeder (over a period of days).  And then perhaps then try banding again.  That's *if* hummingbird stays around, and *if* after discussing with bander he feels there may be success in trapping, and he has availability.  This location is private and homeowner hasn't opened location to the birding public. I have included my long notation here, as I have had many messages asking me for this information. I did not take out my camera to use, until after the bander left.  He hasn't seen photos attached to today's report. Photos continue to show tail fan/spread, which also make Rufous Hummingbird seem more likely. Edit: I want to mention that the Ruby-throated Hummingbird was enticed by feeder set-up and was trapped and banded by Bob.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,5.00,3,,3272,4090

Goal was to trap/band/measure fifth rectrix tail feather and rule out Allen's Hummingbird. The hummingbird was not successfully trapped, despite ""herculean"" efforts by Bob Yunick (bander), ""Dillon"" (assistant bander from Albany Pine Bush preserve), and the homeowner. Bob was able to view the hummingbird for approximately five hours, and was able to view my documentary photos of the fan/spread tail feathers, and gorget photos. Based on five hours of viewing/ seeing behavior/ and looking at my photos, Bob Yunick believes this hummingbird to be a hatch year female Rufous Hummingbird. Bob was able to view my tail fan/ spread photos and the fifth rectrix tail feather does not seem to have the narrow fifth rectrix. The shape of tail feathers did not indicate Allen's. There were no identifiable characteristics to indicate Allen's. Bob used Peterson's Hummingbird Guide of North America by Sheri L. Williamson and compared the plates to my 8/9/22 photos (see my ebird report-same date to see some of the same photos I showed Bob). The photos did not match perfectly to any of the plates, although it more aligned with Rufous Hummingbird. Although Bob could not view hummingbird in hand (to see two line striation in bill indicating juvenile), his views and hummingbird's behavior indicated likely juvenile. Re: ""herculean"" efforts to trap hummingbird: Homeowner doesn't have a hummingbird feeder, thus the hummingbird has been feeding on flowers. Bob's trapping system is a hummingbird feeder in a net surround. The net is lifted half way up the feeder, and has a long attached line to where Bob is seated.

P2 feather is pointed, not rounded, thus eliminating Allen's as a possible identification.","See http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist/S31708075 for original Nov 11th sighting date and info, along with 4 other photos.  I believe this is a Rufous Hummingbird due to photos showing its P2 feathers having a pointed tip (vs. rounded that Allen’s should have).  My guess is that this is an immature male, based on some of the throat feathers showing reddish color (however, I'm not sure if that's a confirming mark to separate the sexes along with its age).   Overnight, it was below freezing with medium strength (enough to knock down nearly all remaining tree leaves).  Thus, I kept the sugar water hummingbird feeder inside and brought it out for second straight day at 6:10 am to see if bird would again leave its overnight roost location just to come feed, even though sunrise was still 30 minutes away (at 6:40 am this morning).  Sure enough, the Rufous did just that, so it was extremely eager to generate some internal heat by drinking the sugar water and letting that energize it. The bird was last seen coming to the feeder at 4:34 pm (sunset was 4:31 pm, so second straight day of arriving pre-sunrise and staying post-sunset).  This bird stayed from Nov 11th-14th, when I had to take down the feeder due to leaving for a few months.  It's a certainty in my mind that this bird would have followed the pattern of other Rufous Hummingbirds in Northern Illinois.  That is, show up in early November (or perhaps as late as the late Dec CBC's) and then stay at an available hummingbird feeder until about mid-January when they either expire due to extreme weather or they migrate out when the temps come up alittle bit.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,5.00,3,,500,700

He has a crooked bill, scissor-like--have heard them hit the screen and windows at times even though feeder is not close to them, so it's a possible injury. However, he is feeding through the bee guards just fine and collects insects from Dahlias and Rugosa Roses nearby--he also followed, then nabbed a mosquito mid-air very close to me. He was extremely aggressive to any other Hummers at the feeder--splaying his tail, chirping like crazy and one time he locked onto another--they spiraled downward, their wings hitting [sounded like a grasshopper] until almost to the ground--then the opponent got free and flew off. He always sat on the same perch--at the back where he faces and chases incoming Hummers. He stayed at his posts [plant supports on either side of balcony] when not at the feeder..from very early dawn to pretty much dark.

Seeing some more photos at the end of the day - orange gorget rules out Broad-tailed, and the orange on the flanks and tail get us to RUHU/ALHU.  Open tail photos (which I don't really have, but other reporters [RM and Sean :) ] do) show broad and rounded outer rectrices (R5s), and notched inner rectrices (R2s).

Homeowner reports the bird has been present for roughly 2 weeks. An immature male/adult female Selasphorus hummingbird, with rufous flanks, a green back, and a patch of red gorget feathers. At the time of observation, we were unable to obtain spread tail photos, but many photos were taken of the bird.  Upon review of photos taken this morning by Matt Misewicz, the spread tail seems to show wide outer retrices suggesting this bird is a Rufous, rather than an Allen's Hummingbird. I feel comfortable counting it as such - unless the bird ends up getting banded and new information regarding it's ID arises.  Homeowners are alright with people viewing the hummingbird, please park on the street and view from the sidewalk unless invited up.

Photos. Tail feather shape points to Rufous, at one point Merlin picked up the call notes as Rufous as well for what that’s worth. Had been checking here on a hunch because there were some salvias and other hummingbird plants and this general neighborhood has hosted so many rare hummers over the years. Caught my eye as it flew up into a small locust on the northwest edge, sat preening luckily for me. It got up and did some fly catching around the oaks then headed north into the woods. The rest of the morning it was regular along the east fence visiting salvias, cuphea, four o’clock and zinneas or sitting quietly. Often flew up and looked for insects in, then quietly sat in, a bittersweet-choked tree across from NE corner of garden. Gave chip notes when active.

Photos. Tail feather shape points to Rufous, at one point Merlin picked up the call notes as Rufous as well for what that’s worth. Had been checking here on a hunch because there were some salvias and other hummingbird plants and this general neighborhood has hosted so many rare hummers over the years. Caught my eye as it flew up into a small locust on the northwest edge, sat preening luckily for me. It got up and did some fly catching around the oaks then headed north into the woods. The rest of the morning it was regular along the east fence visiting salvias, cuphea, four o’clock and zinneas or sitting quietly. Often flew up and looked for insects in, then quietly sat in, a bittersweet-choked tree across from NE corner of garden. Gave chip notes when active.

The original finder stated they may have a Ruby-Throated Hummingbird with color abnormalities that has been visiting their feeder for over 2 weeks(!). They also stated noticing differences in behavior. Permission was granted to enter the property and investigate which almost immediately revealed a Selasphorus hummingbird. The bird was buzzing up to the feeder and resting on the metal rings around the tomato plants for about an hour. As my friend and I watched we both noted the bright green back and the rufous sides with a small rufous patch on the rump(base of the tail feathers). We watched for another hour or so and both came to the general conclusion of female Rufous Hummingbird. After sharing the photos and asking around a few others were set on RUHU.. Still not fully convinced after reviewing photos and looking through guides. I returned the next day at around 8 am to find the RUHU at the feeder once again. I studied the bird for another 3 hours or so and noted the shape of the tail and the rounded outer tail feathers (Allens would be more narrow). Photos revealed a small white tip on the end of R2. I also found that when perched the tail did not project far past the wings as you see in photos of female Allen’s. The photos were also posted to an identification facebook group and confirmed by a hummingbird bander that the tail feathers were consistent with AHY/F Rufous.  Many photos, including diagnostic spread tail shots showing tail shape and R2 feather consistent with Adult Female Rufous Hummingbird",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.00,4,,1619,2429

Matt and I went out early to try to document this bird, not expecting to get to species level but there seems to be enough to be confident.  First noted by homeowner November 9. Last seen….  Identified as Rufous / Allen’s complex by broad rufous flanks and undertail, rufous tail bases on R 2-5 (eliminating Broad-tailed).  Aged as adult female by small red central gorget, mostly green crown, mantle and rump and all green R1.   Identified as Rufous by obvious outer emargination of R2 (see pic 1, provided by Mike Bouman and pics 7,8 provided by Dale Buchner), said to be diagnostic by Pyle, Chartier and Williamson. Outer tail feathers as wide as inner, with rounded tips and in no way pinnate.  Additional plumage notes - overall plump bodied with tail that extended about a half centimetre past wingtips when perched.

I was leaning towards an adult female rufous hummingbird but didn't have time to really study my photos after the fact due to rushed preparations for a trip.  I asked the homeowner who is a birder to solicit help in order to positively rule out an Allen's Hummingbird.    The home owner wrote this to Sheri Williamson:   ""From what I've researched thus far, I believe it's an adult female rufous based  on the slightly pinching on r2, some slight apparent sub-terminal green on r2,  substantial white on the tip of r3, and only mild spotting on the throat. Other  photos show more development of the gorget, which I understand would make it  more likely to be an adult female than a juvie. It's tough with no  comparative Allen's, but R3-5 appear broader than I'd expect to see with an Allen's.""  This is the response to my birding friend from Sheri Williamson of the bird based on my tail spread photo:  You nailed it: Everything I see, including the late primary molt and wear on R3-4, is consistent with an adult female Rufous. Great capture of those tail and wing details, too, and a nice record for Midlothian!  So this did confirm the conclusion that I came to in using Sheri Williamson's great webpage on separating Rufous and Allen's Hummingbirds.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.33,3,,3000,4000

The homeowner, Alex Brasili, is willing to all visitors to her yard at 787 Port Clyde Road with the following requests: Please limit visitation to between 9AM and 3PM. Park in front of the garage, on the right at the top of the driveway. Be mindful while driving up that there is an older, very friendly dog on the property who “isn’t always aware of cars.” People are welcome to view the feeder, hanging from the south corner window, from the front lawn by the well house, or there are a couple of chairs and a table set out. On that table is also a guestbook that Alex and her partner Justin would appreciate people signing.

This is her response:  ""That's a rock-solid adult female Rufous by both the ""pinched"" tip on R2 and the width of the incoming R5.""  Therefore, I have changed this sighting from ""Rufous/Allen's Hummingbird"" to ""Rufous Hummingbird"" and entered it as an adult female.  Original Description (11/7/2021):  Continuing female type, which has been at this location for about 4 weeks according to the home owner.  Small hummingbird with rusty patches along sides and under the wing, green back, fairly straight bill and relatively short wings.  See photos.  The bird's tail feathers appear to be in partial molt so the left R2 (bird's right) is visible in the first photo even though the tail is not spread.  The R2 certainly appears to be ""pinched in"" at its tip, which would indicate a RUHU, but I don't have a photo of the spread tail so I am conservatively IDing this bird as a RUHU/ALHU until/unless a more definitive ID can be made.  Audio of its chip call uploaded, which is consistent with Rufous/Allen's, but cannot be ID'd beyond that according to what I have been told.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.33,3,,1379,2048

Some buff showed through on the speckled cheeks. Compared to Anna’s, smaller overall, with a proportionately smaller head and bill.

Below is her message to me:  I too thought that this bird had more green on its sides than I have seen before on a female Rufous. An expert from California had this comment though, ""I don’t see anything wrong for an adult female Rufous. Some can mostly lack reddish on the flanks, and have greenish in the flanks. Wing shape and length is very Rufous, greater secondary coverts and long and rounded (not short and squared off) and there’s rufous at the base of the tail feathers."" (David Rankin) With that in mind, I think we should leave it at Rufous.    Originally entered as a Rufous x Anna's hybrid.  All green back.  Green on sides not characteristic of a RUHU.  There is also rufous on the sides and it seems like there is more then what you would expect to see in a ANHU.  It also looks like there is rufous at the base of the tail feathers but unable to determine how much.  So I'm not really sure.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,5.00,2,,2809,4214

Continued today along the path from the feeders down toward Music Island, where it was regularly seen feeding on honeysuckle, which lines that path from top (where the feeder is currently hanging) to the bottom near Music Island/the water.   Initial photos of open tail in the field seemed to pretty strongly suggest RUHU over ALHU.  Seeing some more photos at the end of the day - orange gorget rules out Broad-tailed, and the orange on the flanks and tail get us to RUHU/ALHU.  Open tail photos (which I don't really have, but other reporters [RM and Sean :) ] do) show broad and rounded outer rectrices (R5s), and notched inner rectrices (R2s).  The uppertail was almost all green.

However one was seen 12/5 and 12/6. This one is really confusing to me. Small Female/juvenile type with white chest, belly, green above, bright rufous flanks, white under-tail from what I could see.  R1 feathers appear not completely rounded. Light green evenly spangled throat with sharp contrast  from breast. Wings do not reach the end of the tail. Beak is not very long, decurved slightly at the base and has some irregularities. It was not making any vocals I could pick up. The other species I was comparing to was Broad-tailed which is more common than Rufous, but still seldom encounter. I’m posting some photos in hopes a reviewer could confirm.

Photos. Tail feather shape points to Rufous, at one point Merlin picked up the call notes as Rufous as well for what that’s worth. Had been checking here on a hunch because there were some salvias and other hummingbird plants and this general neighborhood has hosted so many rare hummers over the years. Caught my eye as it flew up into a small locust on the northwest edge, sat preening luckily for me. It got up and did some fly catching around the oaks then headed north into the woods. The rest of the morning it was regular along the east fence visiting salvias, cuphea, four o’clock and zinneas or sitting quietly. Often flew up and looked for insects in, then quietly sat in, a bittersweet-choked tree across from NE corner of garden. Gave chip notes when active.

Matt and I went out early to try to document this bird, not expecting to get to species level but there seems to be enough to be confident.  First noted by homeowner November 9. Last seen….  Identified as Rufous / Allen’s complex by broad rufous flanks and undertail, rufous tail bases on R 2-5 (eliminating Broad-tailed).  Aged as adult female by small red central gorget, mostly green crown, mantle and rump and all green R1.   Identified as Rufous by obvious outer emargination of R2 (see pic 1, provided by Mike Bouman and pics 7,8 provided by Dale Buchner), said to be diagnostic by Pyle, Chartier and Williamson. Outer tail feathers as wide as inner, with rounded tips and in no way pinnate.  Additional plumage notes - overall plump bodied with tail that extended about a half centimetre past wingtips when perched. Primaries obviously bowed inward on perched bird. Cheek admixture of green, pale rufous and gray. Slight rufous tone to supraloral, small white post ocular. Throat dotted with greenish, central gorget green obliquely and flashed crimson directly. Flanks bright rufous extending to the undertail coverts. Underwing coverts rufous basally, green lesser secondary coverts. Tail with extensive bright rufous on tail bases of all but inner two rects.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,5.00,2,,952,1350

After a spotty series of visits, the bird has settled into a regular schedule here since Monday, and so now visits at 40 minute intervals on average, although it ranges from 15-90 minute intervals.

Sometimes it spends significant periods of time at the top of the maple.  Despite several good looks and photos of the tail, nothing definitive can be said regarding specific identification since females and immatures are often impossible to identify without in-hand measurements.  EDIT on 24 Oct 2016- The bird was identified as a Rufous Hummingbird from measurements of the tail while the bird was being banded.

Seen about three times between about 8:45 and 9:00 AM, the  first two times mostly the underside of the tail and vent area, as the bird was perched on the opposite side of a feeder. Also seen by the homeowner during the first few minutes perched in its favorite tree, but I could not see it there. Possibly shot by again at about 9:30.  Not banded by Bruce Peterjohn, but from his review of the photos, he thought this was a Rufous Hummingbird, based on the relatively broad outer tail feathers, and because ""the second rectrix (R2) appears to have a slight but noticeable emargination that would indicate it is a Rufous Hummingbird."" He also stated that ""The bird is clearly a female based on the green central rectrices, but I would not want to speculate on its age based on the tail pattern. Young females tend to have slightly broader outer rectrices than adults, but there is considerable overlap and any differences are measured in tenths of millimeters that would be difficult to judge based solely on photos.""

Precise measurements of r1 (central) and r5 (outermost) are then needed to determine the width, which allows differentiation of Rufous from Allen's.  Other measurements were needed to confirm sex and age. Examination of the bird revealed a partially deformed bill.  And, according to Allen ""usually females have a dozen or two dozen iridescent gorget feathers (not tiny ones either)"". This bird also was showing little-to-no evidence of molt, which is unusual.  Its weight was at the low end of a healthy range, and it showed no body fat.  So, hopefully it'll stay around and find enough nourishment before heading on its way. Allen gave Mark the little hummer to release, and after a few moments in his hands the bird flew to the Sycamore tree overhead, then over to hedges, before making a few passes at the feeder and disappearing over the house.  We didn't stay, and let Mark go out to get more nectar. Congratulations, Mark!  Wayne Co. first Rufous couldn't happen to a better guy!

Green back, rufous at base of tail and flanks. While most experienced observers were comfortable calling this a Rufous rather than an Allen's, attempts to capture the bird for measurements and banding were unsuccessful. ID is based upon comments by Sheri Williamson, director of the Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory, and author of the Peterson Field Guide to Hummingbirds of North America, after she reviewed my photos:  ""It helps that this is a juvenile male, which tend to be easier to pin down than juvenile females. The back view is particularly informative in that it shows a) the outer tail feathers (R5) without the foreshortening that makes the front view confusing and b) a broad R2 with a ""pinched"" tip. Not all juvenile male Rufous have a distinctly ""pinched"" R2, and occasional Allen's will show a very slight ""pinch"" farther from the tip on a narrower, more sharply tapered R2, but this bird's R2 and R5 both fit Rufous.""",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,3.75,4,,1041,1041

Park in front of the garage, on the right at the top of the driveway. Be mindful while driving up that there is an older, very friendly dog on the property who “isn’t always aware of cars.” People are welcome to view the feeder, hanging from the south corner window, from the front lawn by the well house, or there are a couple of chairs and a table set out.

The original finder stated they may have a Ruby-Throated Hummingbird with color abnormalities that has been visiting their feeder for over 2 weeks(!). They also stated noticing differences in behavior. Permission was granted to enter the property and investigate which almost immediately revealed a Selasphorus hummingbird. The bird was buzzing up to the feeder and resting on the metal rings around the tomato plants for about an hour. As my friend and I watched we both noted the bright green back and the rufous sides with a small rufous patch on the rump(base of the tail feathers). We watched for another hour or so and both came to the general conclusion of female Rufous Hummingbird. After sharing the photos and asking around a few others were set on RUHU.. Still not fully convinced after reviewing photos and looking through guides. I returned the next day at around 8 am to find the RUHU at the feeder once again. I studied the bird for another 3 hours or so and noted the shape of the tail and the rounded outer tail feathers (Allens would be more narrow). Photos revealed a small white tip on the end of R2. I also found that when perched the tail did not project far past the wings as you see in photos of female Allen’s. The photos were also posted to an identification facebook group and confirmed by a hummingbird bander that the tail feathers were consistent with AHY/F Rufous.  Many photos, including diagnostic spread tail shots showing tail shape and R2 feather consistent with Adult Female Rufous Hummingbird",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.00,3,,1927,2890

The bird was heard chipping and calling many times, as it flew around the yard visiting the two feeders and perching in the brush.  Somerset County birder Jeff Payne has been hosting a beautiful immature female Rufous Hummingbird that was captured and banded by Bob Mulvihill to confirm the ID. On November 3rd, my friends and I were able to stop by and watch the hummer off-and-on for almost an hour before heading up to the Allegheny Front Hawk Watch for a PSO field trip. The bird was very vocal and heard chipping and calling many times as it flew around the yard, visiting the two feeders, and perching in specific perches in a handful of short trees and bushes. Whenever I have gone to see wintering hummingbirds, they are always quite aggressive…especially considering how tiny (and out of place) they are. This young female Rufous was no different – during the time we were there we saw her chase and call at Black-capped Chickadees, Tufted Titmice, and particularly one Ruby-crowned Kinglet that just wanted to quietly forage through one bush in the Payne’s yard.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.00,3,,1184,1775

Even with this, some individuals cannot be safely separated. It is necessary to definitively age and sex the bird before making an appraisal of factors that support one species or the other. Fortunately this individual (at least in my opinion) shows enough characters to support identification.  The center two retrices (R1’s) lack any rufous color in the exposed areas and appear uniformly colored, which is supportive for sexing as a female. These rectrices are also noticeably broad. This, combined with the lack of any visible rufous is good for ageing as a HY.   R2 is noticeably broad and has a thin whitish tip. It only has a faint emargination and a hint of a notch on the inner web (this might also just be wear of the white feather tip as these photos suggest; some have referred to this as ""pinching"" on the inner web which is more obvious in males, but they are probably not seeing the white area  at the tip of R2). Overall the pattern of R2 is supportive for a HY female Rufous.   R3, R4, R5 show white tips and the tips of these feathers are broad. They do not give a narrow impression, as one would expect with Allen's. Also the rufous in these rectrices meets green and not dark, which is supportive for sexing as a female. The overall broadness of the rectrices tips is good for Rufous.   The uppertail covert pattern is similar to that of the rump and mantle, i.e. green with only thin rufous fringes. Allen’s usually shows obvious rufous color in the uppertail coverts, so this makes a stronger case for identification as Rufous.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.00,3,,1221,1918

Pat Andersen has offered to help liaison visitation, and people are encouraged to reach out to her for details and the address, as well as rules on how to access the yard and where to park.  The bird is a Selasphorus hummingbird, with notable rufous flanks and sides, reasonable amounts of rust in the tail, a greenish/gray back and head, and generally pale cream-colored face with a small red gorget spot in the center. While perched, I was able to obtain video of the bird, and eventually it spread its tail, revealing a wide R2 with a notable notch in it, along with wide R4 and R5 feathers. R3 seems to be molting in at present. Combined with the general plumage of the bird and shape and color of R2, Matthew Cvetas posited this bird is likely an immature male.  Many photos and videos were taken, and a massive thank you to homeowner Jenny for allowing a number of birders to come and enjoy this wonderful visitor today!",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.50,2,,1192,1786

Goal was to trap/band/measure fifth rectrix tail feather and rule out Allen's Hummingbird. The hummingbird was not successfully trapped, despite ""herculean"" efforts by Bob Yunick (bander), ""Dillon"" (assistant bander from Albany Pine Bush preserve), and the homeowner. Bob was able to view the hummingbird for approximately five hours, and was able to view my documentary photos of the fan/spread tail feathers, and gorget photos. Based on five hours of viewing/ seeing behavior/ and looking at my photos, Bob Yunick believes this hummingbird to be a hatch year female Rufous Hummingbird. Bob was able to view my tail fan/ spread photos and the fifth rectrix tail feather does not seem to have the narrow fifth rectrix. The shape of tail feathers did not indicate Allen's. There were no identifiable characteristics to indicate Allen's. Bob used Peterson's Hummingbird Guide of North America by Sheri L. Williamson and compared the plates to my 8/9/22 photos (see my ebird report-same date to see some of the same photos I showed Bob). The photos did not match perfectly to any of the plates, although it more aligned with Rufous Hummingbird. Although Bob could not view hummingbird in hand (to see two line striation in bill indicating juvenile), his views and hummingbird's behavior indicated likely juvenile. Re: ""herculean"" efforts to trap hummingbird: Homeowner doesn't have a hummingbird feeder, thus the hummingbird has been feeding on flowers. Bob's trapping system is a hummingbird feeder in a net surround. The net is lifted half way up the feeder, and has a long attached line to where Bob is seated. In cases where a hummingbird is familiar to a feeder, once hummingbird enters the net surround and starts to feed, Bob would be able to release line and net would drop before hummingbird could escape net surround. This hummingbird was not familiar with the feeder and took many steps to feed anywhere and everywhere except the feeder. *For five hours!*.  Bob, his assistant , the homeowner and I came up with many revised steps. The hummingbird feeder was decorated with the hummingbird's favorite flowers, the inside of the net surround contained its favorite flowers.  A large/ heavy planter with its favorite flowers was moved underneath the net surround. The hummingbird fed on all the flowers except the ones near the feeder. The hummingbird started to feed near the planted flowers, and the homeowner covered the favored planted flowers with bed sheets. The hummingbird would feed on the flowers below the sheet, and tried to fly up under the sheet. Then, the hummingbird fed elsewhere in the garden, and the assistant and I sat at the two other planted areas that the hummingbird started feeding, in hopes that seeing us so close to the other planted areas may thwart the hummingbird and send it back to the feeder area. That helped somewhat, but the hummingbird only came close to going inside the net area once (in five hours), but hummingbird was hesitant and hovering closer to the net.  It would have escaped when Bob let net down, and then the hummingbird would be frightened and not return.  The bander left, and then the Ruby-throated Hummingbird landed on a branch in a nearby tree. The Rufous Hummingbird flew in and perched four inches away from the Ruby-throated(!) (that had been dive bombing it). This is not territorial adult behavior. New goal: homeowner is going to set up hummingbird feeder in yard, hoping that this hummingbird will observe local Ruby-throated hummingbirds (there seems to be some territorial disputes between the Ruby-throated and Rufous) and get familiar with the feeder (over a period of days).  And then perhaps then try banding again.  That's *if* hummingbird stays around, and *if* after discussing with bander he feels there may be success in trapping, and he has availability.  This location is private and homeowner hasn't opened location to the birding public. I have included my long notation here, as I have had many messages asking me for this information. I did not take out my camera to use, until after the bander left.  He hasn't seen photos attached to today's report. Photos continue to show tail fan/spread, which also make Rufous Hummingbird seem more likely. Edit: I want to mention that the Ruby-throated Hummingbird was enticed by feeder set-up and was trapped and banded by Bob.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.50,2,,3272,4090

He spends most of his time there and competes with a Ruby-crowned Kinglet.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.50,2,,724,1086

Two other viewers when I arrived; they soon left and two arrived towards the end of my viewing time.  Did not noticeably alter bird's activity.  I observed it visit feeder five times.  First was shortest (less than minute) and was followed by the shortest interval away; most visits were approximately 1 min. long (estimated - I was too busy watching & trying to photo to keep checking my watch while bird was feeding).  Elapsed time between visits was quite variable - shortest a couple of minutes and longest just over 10; I was never as close to feeders as the two there at my arrival (and its 2nd appearance was while they were still there and it stayed there much longer than the first), yet longest time away was while I was lone observer - as was the apparent longest time feeding.  During the time interval between the 4th and 5th feeding visits I observed, the bird spent nearly all of the time perched at a couple of sites in one of the crab apple trees just south of the grain feeders the HOSP were using.

I was leaning towards an adult female rufous hummingbird but didn't have time to really study my photos after the fact due to rushed preparations for a trip.  I asked the homeowner who is a birder to solicit help in order to positively rule out an Allen's Hummingbird.    The home owner wrote this to Sheri Williamson:   ""From what I've researched thus far, I believe it's an adult female rufous based  on the slightly pinching on r2, some slight apparent sub-terminal green on r2,  substantial white on the tip of r3, and only mild spotting on the throat. Other  photos show more development of the gorget, which I understand would make it  more likely to be an adult female than a juvie. It's tough with no  comparative Allen's, but R3-5 appear broader than I'd expect to see with an Allen's.""  This is the response to my birding friend from Sheri Williamson of the bird based on my tail spread photo:  You nailed it: Everything I see, including the late primary molt and wear on R3-4, is consistent with an adult female Rufous. Great capture of those tail and wing details, too, and a nice record for Midlothian!  So this did confirm the conclusion that I came to in using Sheri Williamson's great webpage on separating Rufous and Allen's Hummingbirds.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.50,2,,3000,4000

Feeding at various plants around the yard, and hawking insects. Did not visit actual feeder. Plumage features point to adult female (throat pattern, wing molt, etc). The bird's R2 feathers don't appear to be emarginated, but the outer tail feathers are quite broad and rule out Allen's. This is the third RUHU that Brian has hosted in his yard!    Tim Shreckengost, Ian Gardner, and I raced up to Camden-Wyoming to see the bird for ourselves. After a few minutes of waiting and watching in the drizzling rain, the hummer shot in out of nowhere and perched at the top of a bush and looked around. During our visit the hummingbird dashed around the yard many times, often perching rather close for extended views, stretching it’s wings and tail as if to show off and allow us the opportunity to attempt to get a definitive ID of the bird. Based on it’s molt, gorget pattern, and coloration we knew it was an adult female Selasphorus; and either a Rufous or Allen’s. Based on how broad the outer tail feathers are, we feel pretty confident calling this a Rufous Hummingbird.    Thanks again to Brian for letting us invade his home and yard for a few hours the other day! This is actually Brian’s third Rufous Hummingbird in the last three years – clearly going to show how much these winter hummingbirds love backyards with a nice garden and a variety of food sources.",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.50,2,,1631,2449

I had just glanced out at the feeders around 8am when I noticed a hummingbird zip away. I thought that due to probability it was likely just a late Ruby-throated. I grabbed my camera and binoculars just to be cautious. The bird returned around 08:30 and then I was able to see the extensive orange at the base of the tail, and the extensive buff on the flanks, undertail coverts, and axillaries. There were a few orange flecks on the center and some dull green spots on the bottom of the throat. The cap, back, and uppertail coverts were a solid iridescent green throughout, and the auriculars were a dull metallic green. The tail did not seem long and broad enough to suspect Broad-tailed. I did not notice this in the field, but the photos show a hint of a buffy supercilium. It returned again around 09:00 when I saw the bird perch briefly. The tail extended beyond the primaries. The bird returned once more around 10am, and then again around mid-day my neighbor saw it. I did not see it for the rest of the day.  Details have been submitted to the Massachusetts Avian Records Committee (MARC).  EDIT on 24 Oct 2016- The bird was identified as a Rufous Hummingbird from measurements of the tail while the bird was being banded.

After a spotty series of visits, the bird has settled into a regular schedule here since Monday, and so now visits at 40 minute intervals on average, although it ranges from 15-90 minute intervals.

Sometimes it spends significant periods of time at the top of the maple.  Despite several good looks and photos of the tail, nothing definitive can be said regarding specific identification since females and immatures are often impossible to identify without in-hand measurements.  EDIT on 24 Oct 2016- The bird was identified as a Rufous Hummingbird from measurements of the tail while the bird was being banded.

Today we banded the hummingbird, and confirmed the specific identification as Rufous due to the width of the outer tail feather, r5, which was 4.0 mm. This is too wide for Allen's, but within range of Rufous. All other features fell within normal variation of a hatch-year female Rufous Hummingbird. The bird was captured at 07:57 and released at 08:14. The bird chipped repeatedly upon release from a tree above us.

A ""pinched"" tip is visible on her right R2, unusual in a juvenile female but indicative of Rufous. The slight blurring makes it hard to see, but there is some rufous at the base of R2. The amount of white on R3-5 plus the tiny spot of white at the tip of R2 are consistent with a juvenile female (second-year females sometimes retain a bit of white on R2, but an older female should show more tail wear).""   https://www.facebook.com/groups/357272384368972/permalink/1106458689450334/",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,4.50,2,,1588,2374

The original finder stated they may have a Ruby-Throated Hummingbird with color abnormalities that has been visiting their feeder for over 2 weeks(!). They also stated noticing differences in behavior. Permission was granted to enter the property and investigate which almost immediately revealed a Selasphorus hummingbird. The bird was buzzing up to the feeder and resting on the metal rings around the tomato plants for about an hour. As my friend and I watched we both noted the bright green back and the rufous sides with a small rufous patch on the rump(base of the tail feathers). We watched for another hour or so and both came to the general conclusion of female Rufous Hummingbird. After sharing the photos and asking around a few others were set on RUHU.. Still not fully convinced after reviewing photos and looking through guides. I returned the next day at around 8 am to find the RUHU at the feeder once again. I studied the bird for another 3 hours or so and noted the shape of the tail and the rounded outer tail feathers (Allens would be more narrow). Photos revealed a small white tip on the end of R2. I also found that when perched the tail did not project far past the wings as you see in photos of female Allen’s. The photos were also posted to an identification facebook group and confirmed by a hummingbird bander that the tail feathers were consistent with AHY/F Rufous.  Many photos, including diagnostic spread tail shots showing tail shape and R2 feather consistent with Adult Female Rufous Hummingbird",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,3.67,3,,2205,2554

Last seen….  Identified as Rufous / Allen’s complex by broad rufous flanks and undertail, rufous tail bases on R 2-5 (eliminating Broad-tailed).  Aged as adult female by small red central gorget, mostly green crown, mantle and rump and all green R1.   Identified as Rufous by obvious outer emargination of R2 (see pic 1, provided by Mike Bouman and pics 7,8 provided by Dale Buchner), said to be diagnostic by Pyle, Chartier and Williamson. Outer tail feathers as wide as inner, with rounded tips and in no way pinnate.  Additional plumage notes - overall plump bodied with tail that extended about a half centimetre past wingtips when perched. Primaries obviously bowed inward on perched bird. Cheek admixture of green, pale rufous and gray. Slight rufous tone to supraloral, small white post ocular. Throat dotted with greenish, central gorget green obliquely and flashed crimson directly. Flanks bright rufous extending to the undertail coverts.

Found by homeowners.  Imm. male Selasphorus hummer with a fair amount of orange on the flanks, rump, tail, and nape, and most remaining green around the back, crown, and shoulders. Showed clean white bib, white throat speckled with rows of dark feathers. Made three stops at the feeder, and visited the flower baskets along the top floor windows along the front of the house, working right to left, and perched several times in a larger apple-ish looking tree with small red fruits. Also perched in a small bare shrub by the white picket fence gate, and twice disappeared into a hemlock in the side yard. Also visited low flowers in front foundation garden. I did not obtain any photos of the spread tail, but Louis Bevier did and confirmed this as a Rufous (as opposed to Allen's) <a href=""https://ebird.org/checklist/S75535127"">Louis's notes here</a> *Called several times while hovering around a perch, a sharp chip reminding me very much of a DEJU. Also acted aggressively towards PISIs, sometimes chasing them away from the feeders. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Derek's notes on viewing the bird:  ""The bird is at 97 Ledgewood Drive in Yarmouth. Ledgewood is a lightly traveled neighborhood road, but it is rather narrow. Please park along one side of the road only (the homeowner’s side/odd numbers) so as not to block traffic. Please be sure not to block any driveways, and avoid turning around in driveways whenever possible. We saw numerous young children out on bikes despite the weather, so please drive very slowly and carefully.  Once at the house, walk to the white picket fence on the RIGHT side of the house. The small hummingbird feeder is on the backside of the bay window. The best line for observations and photographs is several feet to the right of the gate.  Under no circumstances should anyone enter the yard, neighboring yard, or walk in, through, or on any garden beds.  Please include the above instructions in EVERY eBird or any other post...We cannot let people show up with only a GPS location or address and assume they’ll figure out where to see the feeder or where not to be a bother.""",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,3.67,3,,2782,4523

The original finder stated they may have a Ruby-Throated Hummingbird with color abnormalities that has been visiting their feeder for over 2 weeks(!). They also stated noticing differences in behavior. Permission was granted to enter the property and investigate which almost immediately revealed a Selasphorus hummingbird. The bird was buzzing up to the feeder and resting on the metal rings around the tomato plants for about an hour. As my friend and I watched we both noted the bright green back and the rufous sides with a small rufous patch on the rump(base of the tail feathers). We watched for another hour or so and both came to the general conclusion of female Rufous Hummingbird. After sharing the photos and asking around a few others were set on RUHU.. Still not fully convinced after reviewing photos and looking through guides. I returned the next day at around 8 am to find the RUHU at the feeder once again. I studied the bird for another 3 hours or so and noted the shape of the tail and the rounded outer tail feathers (Allens would be more narrow). Photos revealed a small white tip on the end of R2. I also found that when perched the tail did not project far past the wings as you see in photos of female Allen’s. The photos were also posted to an identification facebook group and confirmed by a hummingbird bander that the tail feathers were consistent with AHY/F Rufous.  Many photos, including diagnostic spread tail shots showing tail shape and R2 feather consistent with Adult Female Rufous Hummingbird",Selasphorus rufus,rufhum,Species,4769,,3.50,4,,1237,1856

I have never noticed this before in RUHU. I also just noticed that p8 is growing and p9-p10 are still juvenile. This makes it even cooler! Also the green flecking in the back is an SY character.

Similarity of female and immature Allen's/Rufous hummingbirds to Broad-tailed and Calliope hummingbirds also underappreciated, all having a rufous or buffy wash on the sides and some rufous in the tail.
