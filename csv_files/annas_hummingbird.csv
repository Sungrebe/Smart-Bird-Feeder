Black wings with slight deep purple undertones. Tail feathers I observed were black, but I did not observe the spread tail as Beth did on 10/30. Tail extended past wingtips. Bill was quite straight and short compared to other hummingbirds I have observed.  RTHU, BCHU, and all Selasphorus sp. that occur in the ABA area are ruled out due to the presence of rose-pink feathers (or any colored feathers) on crown. COHU ruled out due to rose-pink, not purple feathers on crown, as well as the Tail extending much past wingtips on this bird (they come to approximately same length, if anything wingtips extend past tail on COHU)   I have observed at least 37 individual ANHUs according to my records accross UT, AZ, WA, and now MN. I've observed many RTHU, as well as BHCU, COHU, RUHU, COHU, and BTHU in multiple states. I have not observed ALHU. This ANHU is my first non-RTHU hummingbird observed in MN.  I observed the bird three times for about one minute each between 1:14pm and 2:05pm on Oct 31.

Black wings with slight deep purple undertones. Tail feathers I observed were black, but I did not observe the spread tail as Beth did on 10/30. Tail extended past wingtips. Bill was quite straight and short compared to other hummingbirds I have observed.  RTHU, BCHU, and all Selasphorus sp. that occur in the ABA area are ruled out due to the presence of rose-pink feathers (or any colored feathers) on crown. COHU ruled out due to rose-pink, not purple feathers on crown, as well as the Tail extending much past wingtips on this bird (they come to approximately same length, if anything wingtips extend past tail on COHU)   I have observed at least 37 individual ANHUs according to my records accross UT, AZ, WA, and now MN. I've observed many RTHU, as well as BHCU, COHU, RUHU, COHU, and BTHU in multiple states. I have not observed ALHU. This ANHU is my first non-RTHU hummingbird observed in MN.  I observed the bird three times for about one minute each between 1:14pm and 2:05pm on Oct 31. I returned and observed the bird on November 1, and observed the bird quite consistently from 7:48am to 8:42am.  MOURC record #2023-106, vote 7–0",Calypte anna,annhum,Species,4758,,4.10,10,"",3456,4608

I live on Browne's Mountain on the South Hill in Spokane. Bird #1 (first two photos): This was the first time I'd seen this particular bird (I've had four different Anna's this year). It had iridescent feathers down the center of the gorget but none that I could see on the crown. It had the typical light gray torso of an Anna's. As of 9.11.16 (the date of this entry), I've seen this same bird multiple times at my feeders and flowers. Bird #2: This juvenile male has been a regular visitor at my feeders and flowers since late June 2016. He has magenta feathers coming in at the gorget and crown, and a light gray torso with green spots.

Appeared to be larger in length, wingspan, and 'chucky-ness' when compared to a Ruby-throated or Black-chinned Hummingbird. Green speckles on throat area but no other discernable color other than the green speckles (but sunlight was poor with overcast / cloudy skies). Bill was straight and black in color. The birds behavior was assertive / non-tentative. The bird did not seem to 'pump' or open it's tail when hovering. Photos were taken from different angles and are not cropped or edited in any way. Can provide additional photos if requested. I've included photos of tail top and undertail but have no photos of 'open tail' feathers.

This is a medium-sized hummingbird, larger than a Rufous or Calliope, about the same size as a Broad-tailed, and smaller and chunkier than a Black-chinned.  There is no rufous coloration on the flanks, or in any of the tail feathers, which are tipped in white.  The bill is shorter and less curved than a Black-chinned.  In most presentations, the bill appears completely straight.  The widths of the primary feathers are almost constant from P1 to P10, and the secondaries are squared off to emarginated. The central tail feathers, while still green, are noticeably darker than the outer tail feathers, another characteristic of Anna's.  This bird shows buffy edges to its feathers, noticeable everywhere except on the lower back, suggesting the bird is a hatch-year bird.  I could not discern any grooves on the bill, which would confirm it as a juvenile, but the pictures may not have the resolution needed to make that call.  The emerging gorget pattern of rosy spangles resembles that of an adult female, and there are no incoming spangles on the head or crown (which, had they been present, would suggest immature male). When perched, the bird sometimes shows wings longer than tail, uncharacteristic of female Anna's.  However, it is possible that the bird is in mid-molt and that the tail feathers have not fully grown in. Altogether, these features suggest the bird is a hatch-year female, likely hatched in the January 2022 time frame.  If so, the bird would likely be a stray from the coastal climate of the west coast or Baja California.  Thanks to Mohini Rawool-Sullivan and John Sullivan for locating and identifying this bird.",Calypte anna,annhum,Species,4758,,4.67,3,"",1280,1920

I believe he sleeps in a bush in my backyard--at least, that's were I saw him retire at dusk one evening, and emerge from at dawn (on a different day). He often drinks from the feeder and then perches there for awhile, usually for a few minutes, but sometimes for as long as 15-20 minutes. I have no flowers anymore. The temperatures in Spokane have been as low as the teens and we've had several inches of snow. This hummingbird has been with me since Oct. 10, although he disappeared for two weeks, from October 28-Nov. 12.

While the second was there I drove home to see if my young male was at my house and when I got there he was.  I called people at Word house and they said second one just left.

Waited for a while and watched adult male then the second one showed up. Female or juvenile male like at my house. Took some photos of both.  They interacted but did not chase each off.  While the second was there I drove home to see if my young male was at my house and when I got there he was.  I called people at Word house and they said second one just left. We were pretty sure we had verified a third one in town.  Later I did photo comparisons and it appears that the juvenile male seen today as a second bird at Word location is also the bird in my yard.
