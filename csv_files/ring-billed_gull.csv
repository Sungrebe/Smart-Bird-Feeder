I saw some high flying juvenile larus gulls that are probably herring but they were too high up to confirm, and all the gulls that were in the water (most of them south of the big boardwalk out in the open where they aren't foraging like the ducks north of the boardwalk) were ring billed. a lot of the gulls were perched on the fences of the big boardwalk as we walked by, every time we passed that boardwalk they were there. I would walk very slowly to them ( I just wanted to get by) and they would intially back up slowly, but still unwilling to fly off, and then as I got even closer they would start moving more and then one would call, sending the entire group flying. sometimes several bolder individuals would be left standing there, about 1-2m from me, and I could get some very nice photos of them. as I had to walk by them , those individuals eventually flew away too. what else was really interesting is that many of the gulls perched on the wooden poles with mini houses along the boardwalk both north and south of it, I assume them to be swallow boxes. at one point one gull was perched on one of these boxes, and another gull came and tried to usurp the spot, coming close and trying to get the gull the go away; the gull already on the box called loudly and sent that gull flying off, these little fights for perched on these boxes (even though there were plenty of other boxes to perch on nearby) were pretty frequent and fun to watch! a lot of juveniles and molting individuals, I could identify some juveniles with fully brown plumage and know which ones are immature but beyond that, identifying first second year birds. etc. I have no experience",Larus delawarensis,ribgul,Species,6455,,4.88,25,,2787,2356

The bird frequently demonstrated nerves of steel as it watched the game from the north sidelines and worked its way from midfield to the 40 yard line.    At one point game officials were actively considering encouraging the bird off the playing field but at least one informed fan warned them to “think about the Migratory Bird Act.” The officials demurred: one of the few decisions they got correct during the game.  The match continued under the close attention of the gull, though at one point late in the Fourth Quarter, the RedBlacks mascot “Big Joe” chased the bird off the field to an unmistakable chorus of boos.  The gull circled the stadium twice and then settled in the opposite end zone where Big Joe – clearly aware of the profoundly poor birding ethics he demonstrated by deliberately flushing the gull mere moments earlier – tried unsuccessfully to entice the bird off the field with what appeared to be a plate of French Fries.  As a hatch-year bird almost certainly from a well-known colony within the National Capital Region, the gull is an Ottawa RedBlacks fan by birth.  Unlike other attendees who don’t understand that anything can happen in the CFL in the last five minutes and leave the game early, this young larid was determined to stay for the remainder of the game and seemed emboldened by stadium-wide chants of “Let’s Go Seagull” and overwhelming fan reaction whenever it appeared on the large screen monitor of the West End Zone.  Television coverage clearly shows the bird watching from the Ottawa RedBlacks 10-yard line as the team successfully converted a touchdown with 3:24 remaining in the game.  The gull stayed until the end of the game and was last seen celebrating the Ottawa Redblacks 33-6 victory over the Calgary Stampeders from mid-field.  Record shots are attached.",Larus delawarensis,ribgul,Species,6455,,4.18,39,,979,1438

I saw some high flying juvenile larus gulls that are probably herring but they were too high up to confirm, and all the gulls that were in the water (most of them south of the big boardwalk out in the open where they aren't foraging like the ducks north of the boardwalk) were ring billed. a lot of the gulls were perched on the fences of the big boardwalk as we walked by, every time we passed that boardwalk they were there. I would walk very slowly to them ( I just wanted to get by) and they would intially back up slowly, but still unwilling to fly off, and then as I got even closer they would start moving more and then one would call, sending the entire group flying. sometimes several bolder individuals would be left standing there, about 1-2m from me, and I could get some very nice photos of them. as I had to walk by them , those individuals eventually flew away too. what else was really interesting is that many of the gulls perched on the wooden poles with mini houses along the boardwalk both north and south of it, I assume them to be swallow boxes. at one point one gull was perched on one of these boxes, and another gull came and tried to usurp the spot, coming close and trying to get the gull the go away; the gull already on the box called loudly and sent that gull flying off, these little fights for perched on these boxes (even though there were plenty of other boxes to perch on nearby) were pretty frequent and fun to watch! a lot of juveniles and molting individuals, I could identify some juveniles with fully brown plumage and know which ones are immature but beyond that, identifying first second year birds. etc. I have no experience",Larus delawarensis,ribgul,Species,6455,,4.83,6,,3057,5019

Unable to identify any other gull species, except one immature of unknown type. Number was a rough guess based on constantly moving flock.  Update: I initially had a rough guess at the number, guessing ""500"". This number was derived by scanning the entire flock, and deciding that 500 seemed decent. I didn't put much thought into it, didn't count individually, by tens, or hundreds (that I recall, long after), but figured, ""Yeah, 500 sounds right."" I would have said less than 2000, but more than 100, if asked.   After talking at length to an eBird reviewer (Ian Worley), I am updating this number to 650, based on my guesses on how many birds were in the frames of each of the three photos I uploaded, and how many were outside of the frame at the time. Ian graciously counted the number of gulls in the frames: 211, 127, and 104, respectively. Based on my guessed proportions when talking to Ian, of 30% of the birds in the frame (for the flying one), 15% of birds, and 15% of birds in the frame, we come to a general guess of 650 for the right proportions of total birds in the area.   My estimate was likely an undercount.

I saw some high flying juvenile larus gulls that are probably herring but they were too high up to confirm, and all the gulls that were in the water (most of them south of the big boardwalk out in the open where they aren't foraging like the ducks north of the boardwalk) were ring billed. a lot of the gulls were perched on the fences of the big boardwalk as we walked by, every time we passed that boardwalk they were there. I would walk very slowly to them ( I just wanted to get by) and they would intially back up slowly, but still unwilling to fly off, and then as I got even closer they would start moving more and then one would call, sending the entire group flying. sometimes several bolder individuals would be left standing there, about 1-2m from me, and I could get some very nice photos of them. as I had to walk by them , those individuals eventually flew away too. what else was really interesting is that many of the gulls perched on the wooden poles with mini houses along the boardwalk both north and south of it, I assume them to be swallow boxes. at one point one gull was perched on one of these boxes, and another gull came and tried to usurp the spot, coming close and trying to get the gull the go away; the gull already on the box called loudly and sent that gull flying off, these little fights for perched on these boxes (even though there were plenty of other boxes to perch on nearby) were pretty frequent and fun to watch! a lot of juveniles and molting individuals, I could identify some juveniles with fully brown plumage and know which ones are immature but beyond that, identifying first second year birds. etc. I have no experience",Larus delawarensis,ribgul,Species,6455,,4.33,3,,3337,5540

So today I decided to go check it out.   As I was driving north on Cranberry Street between W18th and W20th streets (FYI, there is no W19th street in this industrial block), I could see the tower off to my left and an Osprey nest on top of it with a perched Osprey in the nest.  I immediately searched for a place to park to shoot some photos of the cell tower with the Osprey nest.  I saw an empty, grassy lot off to my right in the 1800 block of Cranberry that was a storage area for semi-tractor trailers, so I pulled in.  As I parked and got out of my car, I was immediately dive bombed by a Ring-billed Gull in a state of intense alarm.  It repeatedly swooped at me, giving an intense series of loud alarm calls.  In fact, there were about 30 Ring-billed Gulls swooping around or perched on the nearby buildings.  Several of them were vocalizing.  Based on this reception, I assumed that the nearest building with a flat, 1-story roof must have had a colony of nesting gulls.  The gull that was mobbing me was circling me at close range and periodically landing above me on the utility wires and screaming at me.  I knew from my experience with birds that this could only mean there was a youngster on the ground, so I started looking around.  Sure enough, down on the sidewalk, on the east side of Cranberry Street was a tiny, flightless, fuzzball of a nestling Ring-billed Gull.  It must have fallen the 1 story off the roof of the nesting colony.  I took some photos of it and soon noticed there were actually TWO nestlings on the sidewalk, of quite different sizes, which meant they must not be siblings.  I looked away for just 10 seconds and when I looked back up, they both were gone. Since the building came right down to the edge of the sidewalk, they could only have escaped by sprinting around the edge of the building, around the block to the right, a distance of over 100 feet in 10 seconds!   I went looking for them.  I indeed found them over a hundred feet away around the corner, headed east on 18th Street.  They ran faster than I could.  I felt badly for the two nestlings on the ground, knowing that a neighborhood cat would likely catch them this evening.  Some will ask, why didn’t you catch them and take them to a rehabber?  Two reasons, one, these nestlings could run far faster than this 73 year-old body of mine could.  And two, Jerry McWilliams informed me that many of these Erie businesses consider these rooftop colonies of Ring-billed and Herring Gulls to be a major sanitary nuisance and in recent years have called in Wildlife Services, the animal control unit of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, to exterminate the adults, eggs, and young of both of these species.  The gray building in the photos that I am pretty sure the nestling gulls fell off of is an abandoned building with a sign that reads ""Fabriweld LLC & FW Millworks.""  This section of Erie has several boarded up and abandoned businesses and warehouses.  It is difficult to know how many nests of gulls may be on this rooftop.  Some of the birds may have been incubating and not in view.  Others may have been off searching for food for their young.  It is also unknown if any Herring Gulls were nesting in with these Ring-billed Gulls at this particular roof location.  According to the Ring-billed Species account in the Birds of the World [Pollet, I. L., D. Shutler, J. W. Chardine, and J. P. Ryder (2020). Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis), version 1.0. In Birds of the World (A. F. Poole, Editor). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA.]:   ""Gulls are protected under the Migratory Bird Convention Act, 1994, but large populations of gulls in urban and suburban areas can negatively affect airline flight safety, human health, and agricultural and horticultural production. Encroachments on Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) and Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) nesting habitat are dealt with on a case by case basis""  ""After consideration of the nature and seriousness of a local gull problem, type and ownership of colony site, history and size of colony, humaneness, effectiveness and practicality of various methods, likely effects on other wildlife present at site, and availability of funds, personnel and equipment, permits may be issued by government agencies to affected landowners to reduce the numbers of gulls. Methods include: scaring with shell crackers, bangers, distress calls, falconry, blank (and in cases where scaring is ineffective) or live shells; preventing nesting by installation of monofilament lines over colony or conflict area; preventing reproduction by egg removal or oiling;  Killing of gulls is not permitted except at airports and in other extreme cases in accordance with Sections 24–28 of Migratory Bird Convention Act.  Permits are issued by U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service to scare and/or kill gulls at airports and orchards.""  Also see the paper:  Blokpoel, H., Weller, W. F., Tessier, G. D. and B. Smith. 1990. Roof-nesting by Ring-billed Gulls and Herring Gulls in Ontario in 1989.  Ontario Birds 8(2): 55-60.  Accidentally finding this active gull breeding colony was a full circle moment for me.  On 1 May 1983, at Gull Point on Presque Isle State Park, two companions and I were mobbed by about 75 Ring-billed Gulls, some coming to within 1 meter of our heads.  We looked around and at our feet were about 20 nest depressions in the sand, most lined with woven grasses.  None contained eggs.  A peer-reviewed paper was published on this since it was the first recorded breeding attempt of Ring-billed Gulls in all of Pennsylvania.  See: Hill, J. R, III, 1986.  The First Recorded Breeding Attempt of the Ring-billed Gull in Pennsylvania.  Colonial Waterbirds 9:117-118.  None of the 1983 nests survived.  In the 40 years since this Colonial Waterbirds paper was published, both Ring-billed Gulls and Herring Gulls now commonly nest on several (actual number is undocumented) flat rooftops in downtown Erie.  Apparently, according to Jerry McWilliams, some of these nesting colonies are quite large.  See this eBird checklist of mine from 16 May 2017 of a single Herring Gull nesting on the 5th floor roof of Hamot Hospital on the bayfront of downtown Erie.  See photos here:  https://ebird.org/checklist/S36949968  Also at this W18th and Cranberry location is a nearby 125' tall cell tower with an active Osprey nest on it.

There are talks it may be a hybrid.  Light eye, dark ring on bill and smaller somewhat lighter crescents (Photo #5).  Observed sitting, standing, preening, calling and copulating with a Short-billed gull.  Never saw it fly.  Light yellow eye with what looks to be surrounded by pink. Bill has an orange coloration with a dark ring near the tip.  Pattern on wings seems to be different when preening, not so sure. (see photos).  The Ring-Billed is in back in the preening photo.  Called when a Raven flew over.  Assumed to be a female since the Short-billed gull mounted it.  Prior to copulation, she walked over to the male SB gull they seemed to nose one another with bill tipping.  They then circled a few times and the mounting occurred.  I have more photos than posted.  I thought these were the sharpest and most noteworthy in my opinion. *See note above on ebird checklist comments regarding access and visitation to site.",Larus delawarensis,ribgul,Species,6455,,5.00,2,,4640,6960
