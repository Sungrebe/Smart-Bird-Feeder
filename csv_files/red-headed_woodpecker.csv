There was a physical squabble with the Red-headed being the clear winner. The Blue Jay left and in two or three minutes the same (presumably the same) Jay returned with five of his kin. They yelled at the Red-headed but didn't go near it. It appeared that the Red-headed didn't even bother looking in their direction.

While I watched the first bird (probably male) it would fly off and get an acorn, and bring it back to the hole in the tree.  It would present the nut, as if offering it to a mate, but got no response.  It finally cached the nut, then flew off and returned with a bug.  It again presented it's offering, and again no result, so it finally ate the bug, then flew off and returned with another nut.  Later the second bird flew in from the trees near the trail and landed on a skinny dead tree.  The first bird seemed to be trying to coax the second one toward the big tree, but it stayed on a skinny tree which it used as a base for flying off to hawk insects.   Photos",Melanerpes erythrocephalus,rehwoo,Species,11035,,5.00,6,,1419,1135

I did not resist the temptation! Even getting this somewhat shadowed photo of that pose by this dramatically patterned red, white, and black bird was highly gratifying.","This Red-headed Woodpecker used several of the trees directly behind the Convention Center. I had no trouble getting photos of it, although, in accord with its reputaton as a high-activity creature, it frequently moved often from branch to branch and tree to tree in search of food, of which it appeared to relish a variety of kinds (see Photo ML49907591). It had been in the area for some days, as reported by others. Because of the late-day character of our visit, the sun was on the bay (west) wide of the woodpecker wherever it landed, and the trees it favored tended to be those directly east of a marshy area that was behind them. It would not, therefore, have been easy in principle to get to the west side of the bird for unshadowed photos. Also, in any effort to get to the west side of this bird (i.e., adjacent to the marsh), I would have had to walk close to it as it foraged in a tree. Thus, any effort to do so potentially could have disturbed its efforts to feed and probably would have flushed it. It would be better, I thought, to have somewhat shadowed images than to interfere with its effots to feed. PLEASE NOTE: This species, unlike many woodpecker species, does not display field-visible differences in the sexes. For this reason, I was unable to declare the sex of this individual despite having close looks and getting close (telephoto) photos.",Melanerpes erythrocephalus,rehwoo,Species,11035,,4.14,7,,1613,1210

We observed them about 2 miles into the trail just as the burn area began. During the course of our extended observation, we saw three adult woodpeckers foraging (mostly in the dead forest on the opposite side of the stream as the trail) and occasionally visiting a nest cavity. We could hear noises from the chicks within the nest, but I’m not including those in the count since I don’t have any idea how many there were. We saw one of the RHWO bring a caterpillar of some sort to the nest. Interestingly, they were extremely efficient when visiting the nest. They usually wouldn’t go fully inside the nest, instead opting to feed the chicks quickly and then quickly fly away. It was really cool to watch them visiting the nest and forage, not something you often get to see around here. The birds themselves were very distinctive and there is not possible confusion species. They had bright red heads with white bellies and black backs. In flight, they had broad white wing patches. The only other Melanerpes woodpecker in this area would be Lewis’s, which we also observed and looks significantly different and darker. As with other Melanerpes woodpeckers, the three individuals we observed showed a high degree of sociability between themselves (and a little bit of hostility towards the Lewis’s Woodpeckers on one occasion when one got a little too close to the nest) and we often would observe two perched together on the same branch. They also were vocalizing frequently, giving both short rattling calls as well as short squawk-like screams. Photos and audio that",Melanerpes erythrocephalus,rehwoo,Species,11035,,4.75,4,,2971,1981

A quick binocular view from about 30 ft showed the head to be very dark, almost black, ruling out the common similarly sized RBWO and HAWO.  The bird made multiple extended visits during the next 90 minutes coming back to the suet feeder, foraging on the ground under the feeders, eating at a feeder with a hot pepper NoMess cylinder and flying up to branches in adjacent large oak trees.  The initial visual impression of the flying bird was that it had much more solid white on it than the resident woodpeckers.  At one point, it chased a RBWO into a nearby tree and their close proximity showed that the birds were similar in size.  Photos were taken and the bird was slightly smaller than a BLJA and about the same size as a NOCA in the same frame.  The bird had a very dark upper back and a contrasting very light or white lower back.  While the color of the head appeared dark or black while in the shade, the head was clearly brown when seen in the direct sun.

Got some shots for ID.   When facing the yellow posts of the basketball court, they are on the left side. They basically stayed among a specific small area on the hill. At one point, they got spooked by a squirrel who climbed seemingly intentionally up to them on their snag. I have been trying to see this bird species for years and I'm so happy!

Got some shots for ID.   When facing the yellow posts of the basketball court, they are on the left side. They basically stayed among a specific small area on the hill. At one point, they got spooked by a squirrel who climbed seemingly intentionally up to them on their snag. I have been trying to see this bird species for years and I'm so happy!

At first, following almost an hour of waiting, we heard aggressive rattle-churr calls south of the house. I then saw the Red-headed Woodpecker and a Hairy Woodpecker flying away, maybe the Hairy in chase. At that time I saw the white rump and almost contiguous white of secondaries and that's it. Later we saw the Red-headed Woodpecker well in trees and at feeders. This bird had a habit of taking some food from the feeders and processing it or caching it in small nooks along the trunk of a tree. The area showed signs of repeated visits, and indeed Trevor had seen that behavior earlier in the day. The bird also uttered a low, soft churr before descending to the feeders. Trevor later heard the bird do this repeatedly and captured on audio of that soft call.  A medium-sized woodpecker that looks short in body length but with some bulk. The entire head, chin and throat were deep crimson, with a narrow black bar across the bottom of the red where it met the snow white underparts. Back, wing coverts, and tail jet black. Secondaries gleaming snow white, forming triangular block of white on folded wing. Bill thin and moderately long by proportion; the basal two thirds gray and the tip black. Eye and feet color not noted in the field.  This is a rare bird for Somerset County, with at least one previous record in the town of Fairfield. This spring, 2022, has seen what I think of more than the usual number of the species in Maine for this time of year.",Melanerpes erythrocephalus,rehwoo,Species,11035,,4.00,4,,1600,2400

I ran into Diane Bliss here and we were trying to relocate it, viewing from a berm or old railroad bed trail that runs along the one side of the wetlands. There are a couple of spots where footpaths can be seen going down to the water - there is one with a blue barrel nearby lying in the brush - this is where I found it up in one of the many dead snags right close to shore. It was not initially there when I started scanning. But suddenly I heard a blue jay making a lot of noise just above me and then woodpecker calls that did not sound familiar to me. I looked up through the leaves and saw the jay, so at first I thought it was the jay doing mimic calls. But then I saw the familiar shape of a woodpecker clinging to the top of a tree.

I saw all four immature RHWs in a single view, but couldn't get a good picture of all four.  Then I saw three adults together....I never saw the fourth adult with the other three.  Each bird is distinct up close.  I can recognize the four immature birds by how light or dark they are, how many streaks on the breast and where the red is beginning to come in. A couple individuals have red beginning to show around the eye or at the edge on the dark.  One of the adults looks very ragged and seems to be molting.  I have been through 15 cakes of suet in 10 days and many bags of peanut nuggets.

A quick binocular view from about 30 ft showed the head to be very dark, almost black, ruling out the common similarly sized RBWO and HAWO.  The bird made multiple extended visits during the next 90 minutes coming back to the suet feeder, foraging on the ground under the feeders, eating at a feeder with a hot pepper NoMess cylinder and flying up to branches in adjacent large oak trees.  The initial visual impression of the flying bird was that it had much more solid white on it than the resident woodpeckers.  At one point, it chased a RBWO into a nearby tree and their close proximity showed that the birds were similar in size.  Photos were taken and the bird was slightly smaller than a BLJA and about the same size as a NOCA in the same frame.  The bird had a very dark upper back and a contrasting very light or white lower back.  While the color of the head appeared dark or black while in the shade, the head was clearly brown when seen in the direct sun.

The birds were in the same area described by othes - a previously logged area.  One bird was at the tree where it had been seen by others, but I didn't see the other bird at first.  While I watched the first bird (probably male) it would fly off and get an acorn, and bring it back to the hole in the tree.  It would present the nut, as if offering it to a mate, but got no response.  It finally cached the nut, then flew off and returned with a bug.  It again presented it's offering, and again no result, so it finally ate the bug, then flew off and returned with another nut.  Later the second bird flew in from the trees near the trail and landed on a skinny dead tree.  The first bird seemed to be trying to coax the second one toward the big tree, but it stayed on a skinny tree which it used as a base for flying off to hawk insects.   Photos",Melanerpes erythrocephalus,rehwoo,Species,11035,,3.50,6,,736,589

This species continues to decline throughout its range in the Eastern US where aggressive introduced European Starlings may usurp woodpecker nesting cavities. Males and females are similar. Although appearing to be a full adult, this bird may be second calendar year (SY) or third year (TY) based on small dark spots near the tips of the outer secondaries.",Melanerpes erythrocephalus,rehwoo,Species,11035,,3.75,4,,803,1024

This immature bird has some red plumage emerging on the mostly brown head. The dark, not quite black back is offset by white on the trailing edges of each feather giving the appearance of barring. Some adult black plumage can be seen on the back.  The white secondary patch is interrupted by black primaries also trimmed in white on the trailing edges. A prominent white rump patch offsets the black ratricies.  Most of the previous records for Mount Desert Island (2013 etc.) have been adult but, in this case, an immature bird has taken up temporary residency in this Manset neighborhood because of the numerous numbers of suet and seed feeders which it is actively defending against Hairy Woodpecker, who approached the area calling in advance. There are several dead American Ash trees in the neighborhood which have cavities suitable for nighttime roosting. During the day, it is actively feeding during the 10 to 2 hours. Several distinctive “queerrp” calls were emitted especially when HAWO approached the area sounding a bit like RBWO. Mostly RHWO was silent and hiding on the opposite side of a steady NW cold 30F wind.

The nest must've been very deep in the tree because both parents dive deep into the wide open cavity delivering bugs and fruit.  We compared before and after pictures and think that the break occurred (likely in a storm yesterday) just below the bird tail in photo 9713. We hope the babies can survive the elements and hawks that nest in the yard next to the damaged tree.  The parents seem very dedicated and attentive.

First spotted by Sylvan as we were in a huge flurry of activity.  At first glance of this woodpecker, the white secondaries immediately jumped out on an other wise brownish woodpecker of medium size (smaller than Flickers).  Bird did not stay perched long initially and flew from mature Russian Olive group on right (north) side of prairie to the large cottonwood directly across prairie to the south.  Here the white panel of secondary feathers really stood out, as did the white rump.  Was able to get diagnostic photos on that initial flight.  We pursued across the prairie to the big cottonwood for better looks/photos.  The bird flew quickly around 2-3 perches before setting somewhere up high and hidden.  After about 15 mins, we gave up and continued on with survey.  After survey we were able to see the RHWO again, and watch as it come over to feed on fruits from the Russian Olive, and flying some back across to the more dense shelter of the Cottonwood.  This individual lacked the red head of an adult, but instead of overall a dark brown color on head, and back more blackish with some mottling and paler feather edges. Bright white secondaries with an incomplete black barring across and more complete black subterminal tip to those secondaries.  Primaries and retrices more blackish in color, slightly darker than the very dark brown head/mantle.  Vocalizations were limited almost exclusively to a low-pitched rattle or clucking.  1st species record for LCWP.  Appears to be a 5th bird for county (eBird era).  Wondering if this could be same individual as recently found along river at Buckman Road (or from Los Alamos population).",Melanerpes erythrocephalus,rehwoo,Species,11035,,4.50,2,,1353,2035

This species has been seen here before and bred or tried to breed here several years back. I ran into Diane Bliss here and we were trying to relocate it, viewing from a berm or old railroad bed trail that runs along the one side of the wetlands. There are a couple of spots where footpaths can be seen going down to the water - there is one with a blue barrel nearby lying in the brush - this is where I found it up in one of the many dead snags right close to shore. It was not initially there when I started scanning. But suddenly I heard a blue jay making a lot of noise just above me and then woodpecker calls that did not sound familiar to me. I looked up through the leaves and saw the jay, so at first I thought it was the jay doing mimic calls. But then I saw the familiar shape of a woodpecker clinging to the top of a tree.
