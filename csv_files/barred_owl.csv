Really extraordinary evening. Full account below, pictures attached. Note that it was night and darker than the photos give an impression of, but I was using mostly 1 second exposures off a tripod to gather more light. I also set the white balance on most to counter the orange colour of the streetlamps.  Most of the evening I was with one owl. I arrived shortly after sunset and watched a single owl flying around and chasing squirrels. I stayed with this bird for quite some time taking photographs and enjoying watching it as it moved around the park. A couple other birders were there but they both left after a bit. I made sure to keep my distance from the owl but was amazed at how tame it was with members of the public who would walk very close to it without realizing.  It switched from its unsuccessful attempts at squirrels and began to hunt mice(?) and would go on the ground in the same place several times as well as on a concrete endcap to a wall (at the circular area with the statue). Sometimes people would walk by and it would fly up above the path, but I also watched as people walked within 1 meter (seriously, see attached photo with the man and know other times it was even closer to him) of it and the owl did not fly or seem stressed. Eventually some unaware dog walkers came by and multiple dogs began wrestling causing enough commotion for the owl to fly away.  It then went to the Theatre and landed on the metal railings for a bit, before flying to a tree near the water and the cafe building. At this point it flew again and I suddenly saw a second owl flying right behind it. I was not sure if I saw correctly but then I spotted very clearly two owls sitting in a tree. They would sit for a bit before chasing each other and both were extremely active at this point and taking photos was impossible as they flew through the night from tree to tree in a chase, but it was beautiful to watch as their feathers would sometimes light up from the streetlamps. I took one poor quality documentary photo of the two of them in a single tree.  I thought at first maybe they would mate as they kept flying directly to one another and almost touching, but they never did and it seemed more like a chase. There was also a scratchy shrieking noise they sometimes would make when one flew at the other (I wish I had audio recorded this as it may have given more clue to what the relationship of the owls was). I didn't get to tell which was calling and if it was simply one bird chasing or if they took turns. The shrieking noise was harsh and sounded to me like it was a begging female call but I'm not very familiar with all the sounds, and the behaviour looked more like one bird possibly chasing the other off its territory? Both were totally focused on each other and ignoring everything else, at times landing right above my head maybe only 10 feet up. It was one of the most incredible spectacles I've seen birding and my adrenaline was pumping :)  Eventually they both flew over the cafe out of my line of sight and over the water to the other side. I followed around but could not relocate either bird and didn't hear them anymore, so headed home.  This raises many questions: is our resident owl for the past month actually two birds all along? Or is there a new arrival? What are the genders? Is it a territorial dispute or will they form a pair? I've been going regularly in the evenings and have only seen one at a time before this, but spoke with someone who thought they may have seen two at night several weeks ago. I hope that in the near future the answers will be revealed either by myself or others. It would be interesting to check past photos taken of the bird by various photographers to see if they all can be matched to a single individual or not. Also worth noting that in the month I've spent with an owl at La Fontaine, I have not heard it do the classic hooting song, but rather only the occasional short wail. So is it not a territory being defended?",Strix varia,brdowl,Species,9117,,4.35,17,,1200,1800

It was there when I first arrived about 2:15pm and didn't leave that spot until 6:30pm.  I watched it change positions (facing different directions occasionally) during the 30 or 45 min. I observed the bird.  Numbers of people walked by within as close as 8 or 10 feet, none of which seemed to bother or upset the owl in any way.  Never once did I notice it acting irritated or alarmed.  I was standing about 20' back from it's perch at 6:30PM when it finally flew off its perch and disappeared silently into the darkness.

It was there when I first arrived about 2:15pm and didn't leave that spot until 6:30pm.  I watched it change positions (facing different directions occasionally) during the 30 or 45 min. I observed the bird.  Numbers of people walked by within as close as 8 or 10 feet, none of which seemed to bother or upset the owl in any way.  Never once did I notice it acting irritated or alarmed.  I was standing about 20' back from it's perch at 6:30PM when it finally flew off its perch and disappeared silently into the darkness.

Really extraordinary evening. Full account below, pictures attached. Note that it was night and darker than the photos give an impression of, but I was using mostly 1 second exposures off a tripod to gather more light. I also set the white balance on most to counter the orange colour of the streetlamps.  Most of the evening I was with one owl. I arrived shortly after sunset and watched a single owl flying around and chasing squirrels. I stayed with this bird for quite some time taking photographs and enjoying watching it as it moved around the park. A couple other birders were there but they both left after a bit. I made sure to keep my distance from the owl but was amazed at how tame it was with members of the public who would walk very close to it without realizing.  It switched from its unsuccessful attempts at squirrels and began to hunt mice(?) and would go on the ground in the same place several times as well as on a concrete endcap to a wall (at the circular area with the statue). Sometimes people would walk by and it would fly up above the path, but I also watched as people walked within 1 meter (seriously, see attached photo with the man and know other times it was even closer to him) of it and the owl did not fly or seem stressed. Eventually some unaware dog walkers came by and multiple dogs began wrestling causing enough commotion for the owl to fly away.  It then went to the Theatre and landed on the metal railings for a bit, before flying to a tree near the water and the cafe building. At this point it flew again and I suddenly saw a second owl flying right behind it. I was not sure if I saw correctly but then I spotted very clearly two owls sitting in a tree. They would sit for a bit before chasing each other and both were extremely active at this point and taking photos was impossible as they flew through the night from tree to tree in a chase, but it was beautiful to watch as their feathers would sometimes light up from the streetlamps. I took one poor quality documentary photo of the two of them in a single tree.  I thought at first maybe they would mate as they kept flying directly to one another and almost touching, but they never did and it seemed more like a chase. There was also a scratchy shrieking noise they sometimes would make when one flew at the other (I wish I had audio recorded this as it may have given more clue to what the relationship of the owls was). I didn't get to tell which was calling and if it was simply one bird chasing or if they took turns. The shrieking noise was harsh and sounded to me like it was a begging female call but I'm not very familiar with all the sounds, and the behaviour looked more like one bird possibly chasing the other off its territory? Both were totally focused on each other and ignoring everything else, at times landing right above my head maybe only 10 feet up. It was one of the most incredible spectacles I've seen birding and my adrenaline was pumping :)  Eventually they both flew over the cafe out of my line of sight and over the water to the other side. I followed around but could not relocate either bird and didn't hear them anymore, so headed home.  This raises many questions: is our resident owl for the past month actually two birds all along? Or is there a new arrival? What are the genders? Is it a territorial dispute or will they form a pair? I've been going regularly in the evenings and have only seen one at a time before this, but spoke with someone who thought they may have seen two at night several weeks ago. I hope that in the near future the answers will be revealed either by myself or others. It would be interesting to check past photos taken of the bird by various photographers to see if they all can be matched to a single individual or not. Also worth noting that in the month I've spent with an owl at La Fontaine, I have not heard it do the classic hooting song, but rather only the occasional short wail. So is it not a territory being defended?",Strix varia,brdowl,Species,9117,,4.50,6,,1200,1800

It was high up in a tree in the same area that I found it two days ago and would switch branches occasionally as it was pestered by the crows. After about 10 minutes or so the crows lost interest and left and the owl remained there and was able to relax and preen. I was surprised that it was still here for a couple days in almost the exact same tree, hopefully it will continue to stay in the park for me or other birders to see (there's plenty of squirrels for it!). The trees I've seen it in are with the picnic tables off the side of the big field next to the school and near the parking lot/dumpsters. It is usually quite high up and can be difficult to spot without the help of mobbing birds so keep your ears open.",Strix varia,brdowl,Species,9117,,4.75,4,,2039,3000

The owl was on the pictured perch below until a dog ran by behind it.  The owl was actively hunting, flying from perch to perch giving everyone great looks at the owl.  It flew down several times but came up empty-handed.  We were all hoping it would come up with a vole.  You know the owl hears and sees something beneath the leaves, grass and other plant material on the ground as it stares down intently, adjusting its head to get a better sense of where the prey is moving.  A second owl was reported in the woods perched high up.  After the sun had set, the small owl was calling from inside the woods.",Strix varia,brdowl,Species,9117,,5.00,3,,751,800

Heard the one adult first , then as I walked on the second adult took flight a short ways from near where the as yet unseen owlet was.  Short video   <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/131317286@N03/33796552703/in/dateposted-public/"" title=""05.11.17 Barred Owlet""><img src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4158/33796552703_a83e2ae4f8_z.jpg"" alt=""05.11.17 Barred Owlet"" /></a>",Strix varia,brdowl,Species,9117,,4.33,3,,2448,3264

I was surprised that it was still here for a couple days in almost the exact same tree, hopefully it will continue to stay in the park for me or other birders to see (there's plenty of squirrels for it!). The trees I've seen it in are with the picnic tables off the side of the big field next to the school and near the parking lot/dumpsters.

It’s a low guttural squeal.  You'll know it when you hear it.  I've seen my share of such encounters.

One squirrel ran across the grass to another tree and the owl tried to catch it but once again missed. Not so easy to catch a squirrel.  Rabbits in he backyard garden may have made for an easier target while feeding in the open.  Photo 1 is of the more skittish owl.  Photo 2 is of the tamer owls.

The sad thing is that some people were getting too close to it just to get a ""good"" photo (people who have cameras and lenses that are over a foot long). It was still less than 30 feet from the path when it flew in deeper, and you could still get a great shot of it from there without the risk of disturbing it.

While working on my roof, I heard begging calls from young and heard two adults hooting and calling.  In the evening, the four young and one adult were at my home.  They seem a lot like cats to me, so I got a rope and tried dragging it past them.  Instantly the four owlets were intent on the rope.  I spent about 40 minutes dragging the line around while the owlets attacked it.  It was pretty great.  They sometimes held the rope firmly while I pulled them along.  They also bit the rope as if trying to kill it.  Much like cats with string. One of the young owls dropped the rope and flew off with what I thought was a rock.  It was a  piece of dark gray foam insulation that I found  the next morning with many tiny bite marks.  After I went inside, the young owls remained at my bird feeder area attacking all kinds of inanimate objects late into the evening.",Strix varia,brdowl,Species,9117,,5.00,2,,3486,5328

This all happens at the intersection of the two gravel roads where you keep going straight to the lower diversion dike parking area, or you turn right to go the Kiep's Island parking area.  I, of course, would not have seen the owl, except that it flew through the woods as I was driving by.  Of course, that usually ends the encounter as it flies out of sight.  Not only did it land, it landed only about 50 feet from me (about 20 feet up in a tree).  It then stayed there for several minutes, even allowing me to get out of my car, kneel on the road, and hiding behind my car, able to get good looks and great pics.  Feeling my luck running out, I then realized why the owl was content on not leaving.  He had is eye on what was apparently, a huge earthworm (like a foot long, like a small snake, but not moving like one.).  The worm was just a few feet in front of my car.  Without a sound, the owl swooped down (less than 10 feet away from my car camoflaged body, grabbed the worm and was off.  Even though he perched within walking distance, I decided he had tolerated  this human long enough, so I chose to relish the moment while he(or she) relished their meal.    I dare say it was worth the extra trouble of driving to the north entrance because they are working on the main entrance road.

Two chattering squirrels appeared on the tree trunk in front of me. In a heartbeat, a second Owl silently appeared out of no where, plucked one of the squirrels off the tree and vanished into the forest. Suddenly everything became quiet. The Owls had made their kill and the Crows and Robins were off the menu and safe again for a little while. This pair of Barred Owls is nesting in the park.
