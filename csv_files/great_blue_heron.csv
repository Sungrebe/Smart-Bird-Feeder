I consulted Sibley Birds East for identification of this continuing bird. Note heavy bill much larger than great egret and overall more similar to great blue heron. Body color is off white in the photos. Stilts are yellow unlike Great Egret and body is quite large. Even for a juvenile, its size was striking. Note how tall it stands. The manner in which it crouches and contorts its neck behavior reminded me of a great blue heron.  I was unable to id the bird by call as it was silent.   The bird was standing possibly 10 ten feet at most from me at various points in the canal. It did not mind my presence as I stood quietly and calmly as I took photos. After I packed up and said goodbye to fellow birders, I noticed the bird flew up the canal to the north slightly and perched on the wood above the island side of the canal.  I also consulted the following page for age identification: https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/how-to-identify-white-herons-excerpt-from-better-birding-book/. This is likely an immature bird as it lacks the head plume of adult GWHs.  Other notes : Thanks to Rebecca F for the find! Incredible bird. Watched it swallow a bluegill whole , as well as drink from the canal. It’s truly enjoying itself in the Manayunk canal. Bird did not appear phased by passing bikers.",Ardea herodias,grwher,Group,7664,,4.33,9,,3840,3840

Almost all white head and neck. Flushed off ground/shore and perched up in tree out of view, then flushed again flying away over tree line NE towards bay shore. After a couple more hours of searching both the shore nearby, Beverly Lake, other nearby ponds, and circling Deep Pond, I re-found the bird along the bay shore at 10:06am not far from Beverly Lake. It continued to move along the shore heading northeast and settling in spots with few people, eventually staying put in a spot along the shore northeast of where Deep Pond meets the beach where there are fallen trees extending out into bay and bluffs along shore making access for people difficult and a nice quiet spot for a heron. That is where I was finally able to photograph it well and approached slowly in the open to within about 50 m and left it alone without flushing it. It foraged successfully for a small fish while I was watching it. The bird had a largely white head (including head plume that is perhaps shorter than most than that on most Great Blue Herons) and neck, all yellow bill, pale legs, and paler wings compared to a blue morph Great Blue Heron. I stopped observed the bird at about 10:34am. This is a continuing vagrant, first photographed (and posted on Facebook) on July 1 by Josh Brown at this park on a rock jetty off shore in the bay by at this park. Photographed again at this park on Wednesday July 5 by Marc Butt (and posted on IDEA Maryland RBA groupme app) in the small pond opposite Beverly Lake. I thought that ""Wurdermann's Herons"" were Great White X Great Blue hybrids but Sibley (https://www.sibleyguides.com/2007/11/great-white-heron-not-just-a-color-morph/?fbclid=IwAR1Xj6bV91KQfHzjF7_ObEBt6s2pCynaHmx7Yxu6Y54L2_JZ3rMILtBVyZg) has a good discussion that raises the possibility that this could actually be a dark morph of the Great White Heron, which makes some sense given the bird's structure (e.g., robust bill).",Ardea herodias,wurher,Intergrade,7665,,4.75,4,,3223,4413

It had a large (11 inch or more) Brown Trout in its beak and seemed to be having some trouble holding onto it, changing position several times. Unfortunately, it spooked when it saw us, dropped the fish, and flew upstream. We did not see the fish floating belly-up in the water, so it appeared to have survived its close encounter, at least in the short term.

Almost all white head and neck. Flushed off ground/shore and perched up in tree out of view, then flushed again flying away over tree line NE towards bay shore. After a couple more hours of searching both the shore nearby, Beverly Lake, other nearby ponds, and circling Deep Pond, I re-found the bird along the bay shore at 10:06am not far from Beverly Lake. It continued to move along the shore heading northeast and settling in spots with few people, eventually staying put in a spot along the shore northeast of where Deep Pond meets the beach where there are fallen trees extending out into bay and bluffs along shore making access for people difficult and a nice quiet spot for a heron. That is where I was finally able to photograph it well and approached slowly in the open to within about 50 m and left it alone without flushing it. It foraged successfully for a small fish while I was watching it. The bird had a largely white head (including head plume that is perhaps shorter than most than that on most Great Blue Herons) and neck, all yellow bill, pale legs, and paler wings compared to a blue morph Great Blue Heron. I stopped observed the bird at about 10:34am. This is a continuing vagrant, first photographed (and posted on Facebook) on July 1 by Josh Brown at this park on a rock jetty off shore in the bay by at this park. Photographed again at this park on Wednesday July 5 by Marc Butt (and posted on IDEA Maryland RBA groupme app) in the small pond opposite Beverly Lake. I thought that ""Wurdermann's Herons"" were Great White X Great Blue hybrids but Sibley (https://www.sibleyguides.com/2007/11/great-white-heron-not-just-a-color-morph/?fbclid=IwAR1Xj6bV91KQfHzjF7_ObEBt6s2pCynaHmx7Yxu6Y54L2_JZ3rMILtBVyZg) has a good discussion that raises the possibility that this could actually be a dark morph of the Great White Heron, which makes some sense given the bird's structure (e.g., robust bill).",Ardea herodias,wurher,Intergrade,7665,,5.00,3,,2187,3419

I consulted Sibley Birds East for identification of this continuing bird. Note heavy bill much larger than great egret and overall more similar to great blue heron. Body color is off white in the photos. Stilts are yellow unlike Great Egret and body is quite large. Even for a juvenile, its size was striking. Note how tall it stands. The manner in which it crouches and contorts its neck behavior reminded me of a great blue heron.  I was unable to id the bird by call as it was silent.   The bird was standing possibly 10 ten feet at most from me at various points in the canal. It did not mind my presence as I stood quietly and calmly as I took photos. After I packed up and said goodbye to fellow birders, I noticed the bird flew up the canal to the north slightly and perched on the wood above the island side of the canal.  I also consulted the following page for age identification: https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/how-to-identify-white-herons-excerpt-from-better-birding-book/. This is likely an immature bird as it lacks the head plume of adult GWHs.  Other notes : Thanks to Rebecca F for the find! Incredible bird. Watched it swallow a bluegill whole , as well as drink from the canal. It’s truly enjoying itself in the Manayunk canal. Bird did not appear phased by passing bikers.",Ardea herodias,grwher,Group,7664,,4.00,5,,1080,1620

They are quite good at it but have a strike to capture rate of about 30 percent success at least while I was observing them.   They seem to be actually snatching them from below ground when they get near the surface.  I watched a plant (mallow) get pulled underground from the roots.  It seems the herons anticipate where the gophers are based on the plant movement and very careful observation.  It is tough being as patient as a heron and it is a bit tedious but the payoff is worth it when they finally go into action.  I still feel like I need to watch them some more to really get a good handle of what they are actually seeing and sensing because usually I can't see anything and several times the herons walked very close to me giving me a good look at their technique.",Ardea herodias,grbher3,Species,7658,,4.33,3,,1536,2670

Stockier than Great Egret; thicker neck with a 'burly' look to it. Thicker looking base to yellow-orange bill; dark gray blush to maxilla. Lores were dull green-gray. Pale dull yellow iris. One feature I noticed in Ross's photos to distinguish from Great Egret was the angle of the distal end of the malar (at the bill). Great Egrets show a gradual taper distally from the gape, while this angle looks steeper on Great White Herons and more truncated, probably accentuated by the mandible being thicker. When the bird took flight, dull yellow legs visible, showing a bit of dark coloration on the front of the tarsus (bringing to mind HY SNEGs).   This is the third record of Great White Heron in Maine: ? August 2009 - Mousam River, Kennebunk (York Co.) - photographed - EXIF of photos say they were from 11 August but it has been entered to eBird at 1 August; LRB notes indicate it should be 2 Aug... 23 & 27 June 2013 - Webhannet Marsh, Wells (York Co.) - photographed - this bird looked to be in poor health",Ardea herodias,grwher,Group,7664,,4.33,3,,1403,2105

Bright sun created shadows and contrast in the neck, suggesting darkening, but this is artifact. The neck and head were the same white as the rest of the plumage.","This bird was apparently first reported present on 28 June by Jeannette Ross (via Facebook according to Nathan Dubrow who determined the bird's identity on 7 July). Locals I spoke to had noticed the white bird here all day yesterday when they arrived.  When first seen, the bird was loafing on a beaver lodge at the southeast corner of the pond. It was a large heron that appeared all white with no discernible darker shades anywhere in its white to slightly off-white plumage. The bill was clearly heavy and deep, the size of a Great Blue Heron (one seen for comparison). I noted that the rather stout, long legs were dull yellowish with almost an ochre tinge. The anterior side of the legs was dusky or blackish in parts as were the dorsal sides of the toes, which when curled up and tucked at rest appeared like a dark ball. The bill was yellow-orange, orange particularly showing through when the bill opened. The culmen was dusky to slate. I noted a diagonal, greenish-yellow stripe through the grayish loral skin. This stripe did not reach the eye and was similar to that seen on Great Blue Heron. The irides were pale yellow.  At one point, a Great Blue flew into the pond. The Great White flew over towards that bird, and then both flew around the north end of the pond passing close by in front of us. The Great White then perched about 30' high on dead limbs of bordering trees. The bird eventually flew to the back (south corner) out of sight. It returned a short time later, foraged a bit, and then was flushed by cars. It flew to dead tree limbs at the back southeast corner and remained there until we left.  When loafing, the heron shook its head back and forth (video) and appeared to try and swallow something ""uncomfortable"" such as spiny fish. Indeed video by Jeannette shows the bird capturing a Brown Bullhead (Ameirus nebulosus), which have spines on the dorsal and pectoral fins. Don noted that this pond looked like habitat for that species of fish, also known as hornpout. Jeannette's <a href=""https://youtu.be/_8WzIrpiXxg"">video is here</a>   I have seen this taxon/morph previously on trips to the Florida Keys. This form ""occidentalis"" was described by John James Audubon in 1835. It was regarded as a species until lumped by the AOU in 1973. Although the AOU retained the bird as a subspecies, another view is that these white birds are simply a morph (which don't receive taxonomic standing), but that is untested and somewhat at odds with the evidence. A parallel example is the existence of white Reddish Egrets, which occur predominately in a more restricted range within the broader range of normal Reddish Egrets. More recently, a Florida study by Heather McGuire (2002) found that mate choice was not random in Florida Bay and the outer Keys (i.e. assortative with some examples of mixed pairs). Her view, also supported by limited genetic evidence and habitat choice, was that the Great White Heron should be regarded as a species again. The bird here in Maine fits what we call Great White Heron, whether that or simply a rare white morph of Great Blue. That this bird is in a freshwater marsh suggests Great Blue habitat choice. Great Whites are resident in shallow marine environments almost exclusively.  There are records from New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire that pertain to this form. This is at least the third record for Maine. Previous records: (1) lower section of the Mousam River 28 July to ~9 August 2009 (H. Lavoie pers. comm.); (2) Wells around the Webhannet marsh 18-26 June 2013 (injured bird found and photographed by B. Harris).",Ardea herodias,grwher,Group,7664,,4.33,3,"",2260,3390

Looking further at the feet of this bird, I noticed that it is missing the left toe-tip and nail on the right foot. Would be the 2nd (I believe) state record of this ‘White Form’ if accepted. **Edit** This bird had a lengthy stay at this location until I found it deceased and in the water but still in good shape on 11/21/2020. I was able to collect the specimen which is now in the care of the Yale Peabody Museum. This could very well be the first specimen of its kind in the Northeast.

Almost all white head and neck. Flushed off ground/shore and perched up in tree out of view, then flushed again flying away over tree line NE towards bay shore. After a couple more hours of searching both the shore nearby, Beverly Lake, other nearby ponds, and circling Deep Pond, I re-found the bird along the bay shore at 10:06am not far from Beverly Lake. It continued to move along the shore heading northeast and settling in spots with few people, eventually staying put in a spot along the shore northeast of where Deep Pond meets the beach where there are fallen trees extending out into bay and bluffs along shore making access for people difficult and a nice quiet spot for a heron. That is where I was finally able to photograph it well and approached slowly in the open to within about 50 m and left it alone without flushing it. It foraged successfully for a small fish while I was watching it. The bird had a largely white head (including head plume that is perhaps shorter than most than that on most Great Blue Herons) and neck, all yellow bill, pale legs, and paler wings compared to a blue morph Great Blue Heron.
