However when I got camera and stayed there to take photos it probably felt uncomfortable and moved to another perch about 5 m away, but I could still get photos there. it stayed for about 30 seconds before going far away on tall on trees north of the creek of the aqueduct. from this experience I feel like I've learned that sometimes if you just walk by a bird it doesn't fly away but once you stop and look at it, even if you don't move or do anything, it will fly away, so better pretend you're not focusing you attention on them!!  also my best photos of a cooper's hawk yet",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,7,,1299,1822

It casually flew off after a bit, acting completely normal...   This is also funny because I was just talking with Stan Lilley about how I havent seen Cooper's Hawks close up before...",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,5,,3431,5146

Long rounded tail, large head, pale underparts with fine tear-dropped shaped streaks, buffy ""bib"" of a juvenile. While watching this hawk on the south side of the river, I could hear the second calling, nearby, but on the north side of the river. As I listened I could also hear a third calling, also on the south side, but further west downriver. Eventually the hawk on the north side also flew in and perched above the river. Not long after, the third hawk that I was hearing flew across the river to the north bank, giving me a view of all three at one time. I did not see any adults during the time there.   This is the same location that I found juvenile Cooper’s last year. On July 30, 2020, I heard the calling and determined they were there. I returned on July 31, 2020 and confirmed that there were three, and obtained photos at that time.

While watching this hawk on the south side of the river, I could hear the second calling, nearby, but on the north side of the river. As I listened I could also hear a third calling, also on the south side, but further west downriver. Eventually the hawk on the north side also flew in and perched above the river. Not long after, the third hawk that I was hearing flew across the river to the north bank, giving me a view of all three at one time. I did not see any adults during the time there.   This is the same location that I found juvenile Cooper’s last year. On July 30, 2020, I heard the calling and determined they were there.

I knew right away it was either a Cooper's or Sharp-Shinned, so was taking as many pictures as possible, so could then determine which one. I then reviewed the article about how to tell difference between Cooper's and Sharp-Shinned, and I believe this is definitely a Cooper's Hawk. It also makes me confirm the hawk I saw several months ago, was likely a Sharp-Shinned, since it was so much smaller than this one and eyes were more owl-like, so went back and updated that one. Before sighting today, I actually think I heard it before seeing it, as I heard a high pitch screechy clicky kind of noise off in the distance and right as I was thinking to myself what it was, and thinking how it kind of sounded like it could be a bird of prey noise, suddenly all the pigeons and birds scattered and flapped their wings so loudly all at once, it just made a loud rumble almost like an earthquake, like it was confirming this. There was then a brief pause of silence, while I was looking around to see if any hawks around, and then as though it was entering theater stage left, it just swooped in and perched on the lamp post 25 ft from me and was eating it's lunch or using the lamp post as it's plucking stump. See photos. (WARNING: It was eating a bird, so some of the photos are graphic). UPDATE 7/3/21: I just discovered this is a male. According to a falconer on Reddit, who wrote: """"A question I get a lot is ""how do you tell female Cooper's Hawks apart from males?"" Key features are eye color (red-orange for females, blood red for males), auriculars/""cheek"" color (tan in females, gray in males), back color (warm gray in females, blue-gray in males), plus look at head shape - female has longer skull, male has shorter bill."""" -- [Based on this and a drawing with it, mine looks like an adult male v. female, especially eye color, so I will update it from adult sex unknown to being adult male.]",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,3,"",3888,5184

The front photo shows a typical imm Coop pattern of streaking much more refined than on an immature sharpie and very lightly marked on the belly. (Often Coop’s will have more delicate streaking than this, while sharpies have thicker more randomly shaped noodles.) If you magnify the tail in the photo, you’ll see that it is definitely rounded. Outer tail feathers much shorter than inner rectrices. Just tightly closed. It still looks a bit odd from underneath so it is possible it lost a rectrice (or two) that is just completing growing back in. The original photo showed the limitations of seeing a tightly closed tail from the back. Looking at the underneath view, you see why.  The second photo shows the flatter head and the hackles partially raised, so it looks much more Coop like (square-headed). (And the eyes front). The one anomaly left is that the clean white terminal tail band still looks pretty narrow for a Coop. Further magnified, it looks as though the white tips of the central rectrices might be abraided, as though the bird has spent considerable time perching on a concrete bridge stanchion or brick building, as these feather are no more than six months old. (Or maybe gravestones?)",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,3,,527,792

Several minutes later it flew back near the Black Walnut, and was obviously on the hunt.  About two minutes later it flew through the dense hedges to an unseen perch for 2-3 minutes (20' away, but in dense hedges), then back to below the Walnut and eventually to an unseen location near the ground in the South hedges.

I got some poor photos and a few short videos. It was calling and then I heard another hawk also calling. I found it on top of house across street. They were no doubt interested in the House Sparrows that were chattering in bush out front. I snuck out the side door to try and get a photo of the other bird and or better photos of first bird. As I did, one of the hawks flew to the bush with the House Sparrows. I got some nice shots and a decent video. 4-6 minutes of lost productivity.

Thwarted, the hawk retreated to the top of the bush for a few long minutes, then took his leave. And still, the sparrows remained absolutely silent!  After at least 10 minutes, a few birds appeared on the edges, looked around, and eventually left. Then more braved an exit from the hideout until all were out. It was quite the show.

She thought it might be a RSHA, but I grabbed the camera and saw that it was a Cooper's. It stood in the shallow end of the creek for a bit, drinking then tipping its beak up towards the sky. It didn't seem to be bothered by the collection of bees buzzing around at its feet. I walked outside and got a few photos, then it flew away after a minute to perch about 20 feet up in a pine tree on the edge of the yard. Last year, the COHAs enjoyed this spot, which strengthens the possibility of it being the same hawk (perhaps - or perhaps it's just a nice spot for them). It sat there for about five minutes, letting me take pictures of it, and fully aware of my presence, as it kept looking directly at me. Eventually, it jumped up flew off.   VERY large for a Cooper's, so most likely a female - although the blue/gray coloration on the back would suggest male. And it had a rather small head that almost gave it the appearance of a Sharpie. Overall size, however, confirms adult female COHA.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,4.67,3,,3456,4608

Il est perché, bien dégagé et il me regarde. Pendant quelques minutes, l'oiseau s'étire, fait sa toilette et se déplaça d'arbres en arbres en montant les branches. J'entends à quelques reprises son cri caractéristique à intervalle régulier (un genre de sifflet grinçant). Après plusieurs minutes de recherches à l'extérieur du boisé, je ne peux confirmer la présence des adultes ni même l'endroit exact du nid.  L'oiseau est costaud et ses tarses sont forts. Il possède des yeux de couleurs jaunâtres, les couvertures sont brunes marbré de quelques plumes blanches. Les rémiges primaires de l'aile sont longues, larges et bien arrondies. Les rectrices externes sont plus courtes me permettant d'observer un étagement des plumes de la queue qui se termine par une bande blanche bien visible. La queue prend alors un aspect rond qui élimine l’Épervier brun.  Les rayures de la queue sont égales,et les sous caudales sont parfaitement blanches ce qui élimine l’Autour des palombes. Il s'agit bien d'un Épervier de Cooper (juvénile).",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,4.67,3,,3170,4207

We first saw the Cooper's perched on a branch of a maple tree in the back yard at 1:50 p.m.  Around 2:04 p.m. a gray squirrel began to taunt the hawk and began approaching the hawk on the branch where it was perched, which caused the bristling and wing flaring of the hawk towards the squirrel.  The squirrel went to a higher branch in the tree above the hawk, where the hawk is looking intently up at the squirrel.  Finally, the hawk seemed to have enough of that brazen squirrel and flew to another tree in the back yard where he wouldn't be bothered anymore.  It wasn't until 2:20 p.m. that the hawk flew off -- still hungry!  So we were able to watch all the activity and interactions for 30 minutes.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,4.67,3,,1800,1200

Rather they were mostly sitting in the Styrax tree (very dense understory tree) next to the driveway.  I looked up and there was the Cooper's Hawk.  See the first picture.  This time he was sitting in the neighbor's Catalpa tree, which is planted right next to the Elm - both right along side our property line.  I continued watching the birds warily coming to the feeder and coming to the ground under the Styrax and continuing craning my neck to get an angle on the Hawk.  Right at 8:40 when I looked out the window for the Cooper's - wow, there were TWO of them.  I'd put the camera away and had to go get it and got back in time to grab one picture (see second picture).  I only got this one picture and then the bird on the right flew off while I was trying to take another picture.  The bird on the left stayed (the single bird in the 1st picture) stayed for a few more minutes.  At 8:50 he was gone.      So there is a pair of Cooper's, presumably.  I know male Cooper's tend to be smaller than females but it is difficult to see significant size difference between these two in the second picture.  Except, I think the one on the left is more fluffed up and, hence, perhaps the smaller of the two.  So I'm calling the left one male and the right one female.  There is obviously significant difference in coloration of the two birds.  The left (male) bird is much paler.  The right bird (female?) has much more red coloration.  I don't know if coloration helps sex Cooper's.       I have looked back at the many pictures I have taken of a Cooper's Hawk the last month (going back into December 2018).  Almost every time I've seen one I've uploaded a picture.  Looking back at the pictures I think many times (especially the last several times) I think I have been taking pictures of the bird with all the red coloration, the bird that I'm calling the female (the bird on the right in the second picture).          I can't recall seeing or reporting two Cooper's at the same time before the last 4-5 years, unless it was two juveniles or a parent with juvenile.        A pair of Cooper's has nested in the neighborhood just two block away for the last several years so I'm guessing this pair is them.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,4.67,3,,,

They didn't like when I looked at the nest so I took and seat and waited for them to fly around. 6/27/2018: After being able to observe the juveniles I'm thinking these were the adults. I'm not sure the juveniles could fly that quickly through treetops with prey in their talons. The adults were probably freaking out over the ravens that were showing a lot of interest in their activities. I think the juveniles were in hiding.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,4.00,4,,3456,3456

Size was on the cusp too - didn't seem big enough to be a Northern Goshawk. While the first photo shows uneven banding on the tail indicative of Goshawk, the color overall is more orange-buff overall, especially on the head, rather than the overall darker colors of a Northern Goshawk. In addition, there isn't enough streaking underneath, especially between the tail and the breast. There is a hint of a superciliary line in the second photo, but it's the wrong color - orange-buff rather than white, and it isn't as prominent as on most Northern Goshawks. I haven't seen that unevenness in the tail of a Coop before, but perhaps it's just the way the tail feathers are folded.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,4.33,3,,1652,2203

While not an accipiter showing all textbook ID marks, it certainly showed a blocky head - not ice cream scoop-ish like a Sharpie's. Eyes are small and set more forward - not buggy or goofy looking. Orbital ridge showed more prominently from other angles. Tail tip has no hard corners and white tip on outermost feathers lines up with darker band, suggesting graduation of feathers. Could not see streaking on center breast, however, the visible edge of breast streaking show the more clearly defined diamond/tear shapes of a Coop rather than the typical messy blobs of a Sharpie, getting paler closer to the legs.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,4.33,3,,2132,3198

Two separate birds, a smaller one missing primary feathers and a much larger one were seen loosely associating about 8:30 am, flying above opposite side of the field and over houses to the southwest. They were flying in an unusual manner, the smaller one making fast, at times undulating, moves with deep quick wing beats (at first I thought it was a nighthawk). Both birds had bright white feathers ruffled out between the wings and tail. As they flew back over the field I photographed them, and the larger one appeared to have a dark mask with pale supercillium and a reddish eye. The pictures, combined with the other unusual details and behavior I had not seen before made me think they were Northern Goshawks. When I got home later and reviewed and opened the photos on my computer, it was clear that the barring on the breast was reddish, not gray and the mask and ruffled white feathers near the tail were misleading. As for the unusual flight, it did appear to be some type of courtship or territorial behavior.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,4.33,3,,1200,1800

She thought it might be a RSHA, but I grabbed the camera and saw that it was a Cooper's. It stood in the shallow end of the creek for a bit, drinking then tipping its beak up towards the sky. It didn't seem to be bothered by the collection of bees buzzing around at its feet. I walked outside and got a few photos, then it flew away after a minute to perch about 20 feet up in a pine tree on the edge of the yard. Last year, the COHAs enjoyed this spot, which strengthens the possibility of it being the same hawk (perhaps - or perhaps it's just a nice spot for them). It sat there for about five minutes, letting me take pictures of it, and fully aware of my presence, as it kept looking directly at me. Eventually, it jumped up flew off.   VERY large for a Cooper's, so most likely a female - although the blue/gray coloration on the back would suggest male. And it had a rather small head that almost gave it the appearance of a Sharpie. Overall size, however, confirms adult female COHA.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,4.33,3,,1080,1920

In flight, the tail appears quite long and the head projection is well beyond the wings. Hence, though a few field marks suggest immature Sharpie (e.g. breast streaking quite thick and not tapering off towards the belly, tail tip seemed more squarish in the field, though photos do show slight rounding of a Cooper’s), in aggregate, it seems most field marks point to Cooper's rather than Sharpie for this bird, overall structure wins out in this case.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,4.33,3,,975,1463

However: I measured the fence top rail where the bird is perched and calculated the bird's length. It's at least 16 inches.

They mostly stay on the canal and appear to hunt together. They are quiet and still now while searching for food, except last night when they called louder than I have ever heard them call. I would surmise they were pretty hungry and were calling for help from a parent bird. This am they went after a squirrel in the yard. One chased the squirrel over the fence and then the other went after him. The squirrel at times would stand still with his tail over his head as if for protection and other times run. The squirrel finally hid in a tree. The hunt was not successful but the other yard birds were very aware and feared the raptors staying away. The COHA (pics) on the fence didn't participate as much as the one pictured on the ground and in the tree. Update 8:50 one COHA is sitting in open view on the fence and birds are on the feeder. The chase is probably the only thing that frightened the feeder birds earlier.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,4.33,3,,3648,5472

Large, tail rounded in flight.  Head and neck tawny, head square, lots of white mottling on the back. The placement of the eye seems consistent with what's often said about placement in the Cooper's Hawk versus the Sharpshin (namely that it's close to the bill in the Cooper's and more towards the center of the head in the Sharpshin), but I always have trouble with that feature.  It's hard to make much of the tail from the photos.  It shows a rather thin whitish band at the tip, and the folded tail does not appear rounded (though what's showing in the photos are, I assume, the inmost feathers, which are concealing the shorter ones).  I note, though, that the bird seems very long-tailed, the wing tips barely reaching the top of the third dark band (counting from the tip).",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,2,,1087,1559

This hawk was brown and white most likely an immature. Its eyes and head movements showed it was on the hunt. Doves had scattered a few minutes before and now I see why.  One Mourning Dove flew in and just about landed by the hawk. The Coopers reacted quickly sending the dove fleeing. The hawk stayed a few more minutes and flew right over the house to the north. Did not seem affected by me standing in front of the deck. Interesting to see upclose pics of the pupils and their differences in sizes,Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,2,,4039,2972

However when I got camera and stayed there to take photos it probably felt uncomfortable and moved to another perch about 5 m away, but I could still get photos there. it stayed for about 30 seconds before going far away on tall on trees north of the creek of the aqueduct. from this experience I feel like I've learned that sometimes if you just walk by a bird it doesn't fly away but once you stop and look at it, even if you don't move or do anything, it will fly away, so better pretend you're not focusing you attention on them!!  also my best photos of a cooper's hawk yet",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,2,,2253,1543

Sharp-shinned is rare in this part of San Diego County, while Cooper's are prevalent in Blue Sky. Though I'd love to be able to report a Sharpie here, this is a Cooper's. Comments welcome. 33.016577, -117.020123 Second Cooper's found in nest along main trail to Lake Ramona. Identified by kek call.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,2,"",3229,2312

The squirrel went to a higher branch in the tree above the hawk, where the hawk is looking intently up at the squirrel.  Finally, the hawk seemed to have enough of that brazen squirrel and flew to another tree in the back yard where he wouldn't be bothered anymore.  It wasn't until 2:20 p.m. that the hawk flew off -- still hungry!  So we were able to watch all the activity and interactions for 30 minutes.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,2,,1800,1200

After we'd seen one juv Cooper's fly by and keep going out of the immediate area, we then saw and heard a calling (occasionally) adult Cooper's. We were slowly birding our way in the direction of where we eventually saw the adult (perched relatively low in a Eucalyptus). Oddly enough it remained on its perch even when we were getting quite close, which I thought was a little strange--even knowing they can seem to be relatively tolerant of people at times (especially in a setting like this, with frequent park visitors). Finally, now within maybe 30 or so feet of the adult COHA, a second HY COHA flushed up from along the creek (hidden in the weeds in the area of the ""watering hole"", presumably getting a drink).  After the HY bird flew off, at that point the adult finally took off.  So I'd have to guess this was a local breeder still being protective over it's fledglings, even though they seemed to be foraging on their own. It sure seemed odd seeing this adult not appear like it was going to budge, along with it giving the occasional, loud ""kek-kek-kek-kek-kek-kek!""; definitely seemed reminiscent of a bird that was still involved with nesting duties. However, at this date it didn't seem possible for a COHA to have an active nest, and even seemed a bit late to have dependent fledglings. But when the HY bird flushed up from the stream near us, it all seemed to suggest there was still some connection between the adult and presumably one of its fledglings.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,2,,1525,2505

The remainder of this comment is something of a test of Sibley's mark,  ""adult male Cooper's has gray cheeks (orange on all others)"" (including adult female Cooper's).  The first question is, what is the color on the cheeks of this Cooper's?  I would say it is orange washed with gray, especially higher up, below the eye and behind the eye, but to some extent over the whole cheek area.   Given this mixed conclusion, I looked at eBird photos of adult Cooper's Hawks, first those marked male, and then those marked female.  The result?  There was absolutely no clear separation based on cheek color.  A whole range of colors was represented both in the male and the female group.  The range in cheek color I found (again, present in photos of both male and female adult Cooper's) ran from very pale gray (nearly white) to gray, to a mixture of gray and orange, and finally to orange. (Size is of course another differentiating mark.  The photo does not allow judgment on this point, and I have little recollection of my impressions at the time of viewing, other than the feeling that it was not really small, that is, not the size of a male Sharp-shinned Hawk.)","Sex unknown, though the bird appeared on the large end of the scale, and so probably a female.",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,2,,3002,4003

This ID is from Jon Dunn, based on photos here: ""It's a Cooper's Hawk. In this photo, the bird has a slightly bulky look (subjective) and is out in the open.  Although both Sharp-shinned and Cooper’s can sit in the open, Sharpies tend to go for cover thus making photography very difficult. The head on this bird is rather blocky and the eyes placed forward. The head actually looks big relative to the body while the Sharpie looks small headed. The tarsi or legs look thick. Sharpies have pencil thin legs. Still this is subjective. There is a rufous tone on the top and back of the head and the on the throat. This is often hard to see but is visible in your photo.""  Re breast plumage: ""In the photo, the dark, very distinct streaks are at the top of the breast. Usually, this continues down the breast in Cooper’s Hawks. However in the photo, the major part of the breast has rufous spots and streaks, which are clean and distinct. One of the things to look for in a Sharpie is rufous, smudgy streaks.

This ID is from Jon Dunn, based on photos here: ""It's a Cooper's Hawk. In this photo, the bird has a slightly bulky look (subjective) and is out in the open.  Although both Sharp-shinned and Cooper’s can sit in the open, Sharpies tend to go for cover thus making photography very difficult. The head on this bird is rather blocky and the eyes placed forward. The head actually looks big relative to the body while the Sharpie looks small headed. The tarsi or legs look thick. Sharpies have pencil thin legs. Still this is subjective. There is a rufous tone on the top and back of the head and the on the throat. This is often hard to see but is visible in your photo.""  Re breast plumage: ""In the photo, the dark, very distinct streaks are at the top of the breast. Usually, this continues down the breast in Cooper’s Hawks. However in the photo, the major part of the breast has rufous spots and streaks, which are clean and distinct. One of the things to look for in a Sharpie is rufous, smudgy streaks. Had you gotten this photo at a straight on view rather than a side view, it would have been even more difficult to i.d. due to the rufous streaks. Still, I’m convinced it is a Cooper’s Hawk.""",Astur cooperii,coohaw,Species,8183,,5.00,2,,1074,974
