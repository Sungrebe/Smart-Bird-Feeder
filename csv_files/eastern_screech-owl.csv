Owlet 4 is hidden behind the leaves. ,"Had heard reports of a Screech owl being within a couple blocks of the Park, one morning my Mom and I decided to get up and be out just as the sun was coming up to hopefully successfully locate This owl in the park. As we were heading down the boardwalk I quickly became impatient when we didn’t hear or see anything in the first few minutes,  and went off the path to capture photos of the sun starting to rise (I wasn’t very patient back then, haha). As I was shooting the sunrise, I heard my mom quietly calling for me. As I got back onto the boardwalk, I noticed this little grey ball of fluff with bright green eyes, bouncing from branch to branch in a low tree just a couple meters away from her. it was still rather dark out, so as I got closer I could slowly start seeing more details, like light barring across the chest and stomach, a light green beak and big green eyes, from this I could successfully I.D it as an Eastern Screech-Owlet. As we observed the little one branch, it slowly began heading higher up into the tree’s. as it makes it way up, it accompanied 3 other Owlets that had been perched not 20 feet above us the whole time and began to roost for the day. Knowing that there were 4 owlets around, we figured it was a safe bet there would be an adult, or maybe even a pair somewhere nearby. We started thoroughly examining trees, and roughly 25 feet back (15 or so feet from the owlets) was a Brown Morph adult ESO perched on a broken tree limb tight to the trunk, preening and observing the owlets from afar. I moved a branch slightly to get a better view of the adult owl before she let out a whinny call, the next second I heard an identical call come from roughly 10-20 feet behind me, I couldn’t get a visual. But from the way the ESO we could see looked over, and the identical call, it was safe to assume the mate was on the other side of the boardwalk in the trees ( we did however see both adults later that day perched alongside their young. We checked in for 12 consecutive days (I believe) on the owls to track their development and movements, during this time I was blessed to observe the adult owls Hunting, bathing and just going about their daily activities. I also got to watch the young owls learn how to fly and hunt, I wasn’t able to photograph much of it as I didn’t want to interfere with nature’s process, It was a treat I’ll always hold close)",Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,4.86,7,,1525,2168

Continuing cutie! I first found the bird in its usual spot. I left and then returned to find the bird gone. While I was looking I was hearing all these weird noises from Mockingbird that I hadn’t heard before but failed to put two into together. To make a long story short, when I check the tree from another angle I realized that he’s mocking bird noises were alarm calls and that the eastern screech owl was sitting right out in the open! I’ve never had such good luck at one of these birds. It sat there for about 35 minutes, before it flew off when my mom called (how great, right?). I quickly relocated it after hearing it sing (trill call) but only narrowed it down to a tree. It then flew again, without me seeing it, and eventually ended up in Wicker’s Creek.

This has been my presumption for the last several weeks based on observation of behaviour.  While I have not seen them side by side, the male is the one that vigourously defends the territory and it's always the gray morph that is doing that.  But until I see the two of them side by side, I will not draw any final conclusion.  Reverse siize dimorphism between male and female owls is common where the female is always larger than the male.   It may be sublter in screech owls but once they are perched together you can see the difference (many opportunities to see this at Mud Lake and elsewhere over the years).",Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,4.43,7,,769,703

Continuing cutie! I first found the bird in its usual spot. I left and then returned to find the bird gone. While I was looking I was hearing all these weird noises from Mockingbird that I hadn’t heard before but failed to put two into together. To make a long story short, when I check the tree from another angle I realized that he’s mocking bird noises were alarm calls and that the eastern screech owl was sitting right out in the open! I’ve never had such good luck at one of these birds. It sat there for about 35 minutes, before it flew off when my mom called (how great, right?). I quickly relocated it after hearing it sing (trill call) but only narrowed it down to a tree. It then flew again, without me seeing it, and eventually ended up in Wicker’s Creek.

I thought that it was a bag of garbage at first and then realized that it might be an owl.  This was about 6:45 am.  I turned around and found the owl standing up-right on the pavement.  I pulled over and decided that I must scoop it up with a blanket and have it covered in case it was injured.  This is such a busy County Highway, if I hadn't picked it up, it would have been killed for sure.  I contacted ECO Andrew Kostuk of the NYS DEC who said that he would meet me at my workplace in Cortland, NY.  I met up with ECO Kostuk, who stated that it was good that I picked up the owl.  He took the owl to the Cornell University Veterinary Clinic to see if they could help it.  ECO Kostuk told me that Cornell said the owl was alert and that they thought that it would have a full recovery.  Hopefully, it can be released back in to the wild.  Just an update concerning this Screech Owl, I have spoken with ECO Kostuk and the Screech Owl did have a broken wing and was operated on at the Cornell University Veterinary Clinic.  The owl survived the surgery and responded well and was then taken to a certified wildlife rehabilitator.  The owl was able to make a full recovery and am happy to say was released back in to the wild.",Megascops asio,eassco1,Group,8771,,4.50,4,,3456,4608

I call him the fair weather owl since he is only around on nice days. When spring arrives the owl disappears and I wonder if I will ever see it again. This year it seems to be around more than usual but still not consistent. I put up an owl box hoping to attract tenants with no luck. Yesterday I went for a walk at home in the woods and noticed fair weather owl was enjoying the sun. I do not walk under the tree when he is home so that I do not bother him. He jumps back in the hole if you are seen. Maybe I should call him shy owl. I continued my usual walk. There is a tree that I always walk by and I think if I was an owl that would be a perfect home. Well, it was years in the making but yesterday was the day. There was a second owl in the dream owl tree. It must have been my lucky day as no one is home today except me awaiting another lucky day... - Eastern Screech Owl - Madison County - 3/10/18",Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,5.00,3,,2000,2800

I thought that it was a bag of garbage at first and then realized that it might be an owl.  This was about 6:45 am.  I turned around and found the owl standing up-right on the pavement.  I pulled over and decided that I must scoop it up with a blanket and have it covered in case it was injured.  This is such a busy County Highway, if I hadn't picked it up, it would have been killed for sure.  I contacted ECO Andrew Kostuk of the NYS DEC who said that he would meet me at my workplace in Cortland, NY.  I met up with ECO Kostuk, who stated that it was good that I picked up the owl.  He took the owl to the Cornell University Veterinary Clinic to see if they could help it.  ECO Kostuk told me that Cornell said the owl was alert and that they thought that it would have a full recovery.  Hopefully, it can be released back in to the wild.  Just an update concerning this Screech Owl, I have spoken with ECO Kostuk and the Screech Owl did have a broken wing and was operated on at the Cornell University Veterinary Clinic.  The owl survived the surgery and responded well and was then taken to a certified wildlife rehabilitator.  The owl was able to make a full recovery and am happy to say was released back in to the wild.",Megascops asio,eassco1,Group,8771,,4.33,3,,3456,4608

Fledged at 8:10 and 8:40 respectively.,"Last two of the four chicks fledged this evening.  At 8:10 and 8:40 respectively.  Thought had fledged last night with the first two as this morning and throughout the day there was no activity or sign of owls.  That is until 6 pm.  Spotted chick in nest box opening. Joined by a sibling.  A parent, most likely the female from the trilling I have become so familiar with, began trilling.  The parents did not feed the birds and the trilling was, I think, enticing the two remaining chicks to fledge.  The trilling became louder.  After one chick fledged, the trilling became louder and moved closer to the nest box.  The last one was quite reluctant.  The chicks flew off in the direction of the trills.  The trills were a beacon, I think:  ""come this way.""  It was too dark to record the final chick fledge but observed with binos.  This awesome moment came with mixed feelings and followed up with a Scotch, neat.  An incredible journey.  Six months four days since the male chick (Dr. Who) took up residence in the nest box.  Four healthy chicks and attentive, experienced parents.  One word:  Breathtaking.",Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,5.00,2,Nest,1000,1336

It moved to another great perch to pose for some more stunning shots. At this point I texted Mom to come out and see it. She and Susannah came out and found me. Again, I used playback to lure it back in close - and REALLY close! It swooped in and landed in a shrub less than 4 feet away from us in plain sight (with flashlights shining on it).

Responded to playback before flying out of the woods into some nearby trees where it continued to call back to the recording. I slowly crept up to where it was perched and got my phone out to record it's calls. After recording it a few times I played the recording again and it flew up to a branch not more than 6 feet away from me! I decided to attempt some flash photos with my phone, assuming it would spook and fly away immediately, but it didn't move, it just sat there and stared at the light. At this point I could see that it was a beautiful red morph, and based in the higher pitched call, probably a female. I took some video of it and then decided to go get the camera. Ran all the way back to the house and all the way back out to the spot (apparently I haven't learned to always bring the camera with me). When I returned, I played the recording again to relocate it. Sure enough, within a few seconds it emerged from it's hiding spot and flew right up to a nearby tree in the open. This time I was ready and snapped some killer shots! It moved to another great perch to pose for some more stunning shots. At this point I texted Mom to come out and see it. She and Susannah came out and found me. Again, I used playback to lure it back in close - and REALLY close! It swooped in and landed in a shrub less than 4 feet away from us in plain sight (with flashlights shining on it). It sat there for a minute or two while we kept silent and watched. We waited for it to fly off before going back inside. Such a neat moment!",Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,4.50,2,"",1816,2727

It’s possible that I attracted it by calling the screech owl. I called the GH0W as I walked back but got no response.,Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,4.50,2,,2534,3378

I've been out every night for the past month and many nights before that attempting to photograph this species. I've heard only two during this time. Tonight, about 5:20 PM EST, I stopped and did one call of playback and a screech-owl started singing loudly back to me. I waited quietly hoping it'd come closer but it sounded like it was staying put. Thinking this was going to be another heard only encounter, I decided to turn on the flashlight and scan far back in the trees to see if I could see a silhouette anywhere. To my shock, the screech-owl was sitting directly in front of me about fifteen feet away, if that! I had to try very hard to stay quiet! He sat patiently and let me take lots of pictures. It's crazy how small they are; it puts it in perspective when one is sitting right near you. I had a spotlight (which would have gotten much better pictures) but since he was so close I didn't use it because I didn't want to burn his eyes!! I had to make due with the flashlight and flash but I think it worked great. After about three minutes, he hopped off his perch and flew to some nearby vegetation. He was still very close, but I decided to leave so he could get to hunting for the night. Now I have added the screech-owl to my photography list!! I am so excited! Finally! Thank you, screech-owl!",Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,3.75,4,,,

They were quite alarmed.)  I parked the car and spent about 5 minutes carefully walking around underneath the tree, carefully looking up through the branches. I saw nothing.  I also looked for cast pellets on the ground.  Again nothing.  I even positioned myself so as to have all the branches and boughs silhouetted in the sunlight.  Again nothing.  As I was walking away, the Blue Jays returned while I was still very close, and started mobbing one particular outer spruce bough.  I knew at that point, there had to be a small owl hiding in there because the BLJAs would never have come that close to me otherwise.  Upon closer examination I saw a red-phase Eastern Screech-Owl stretched real tall, hiding in the outermost branches, extremely well hidden.",Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,4.00,2,,1794,2250

Responded to playback before flying out of the woods into some nearby trees where it continued to call back to the recording. I slowly crept up to where it was perched and got my phone out to record it's calls. After recording it a few times I played the recording again and it flew up to a branch not more than 6 feet away from me! I decided to attempt some flash photos with my phone, assuming it would spook and fly away immediately, but it didn't move, it just sat there and stared at the light. At this point I could see that it was a beautiful red morph, and based in the higher pitched call, probably a female. I took some video of it and then decided to go get the camera. Ran all the way back to the house and all the way back out to the spot (apparently I haven't learned to always bring the camera with me). When I returned, I played the recording again to relocate it. Sure enough, within a few seconds it emerged from it's hiding spot and flew right up to a nearby tree in the open. This time I was ready and snapped some killer shots! It moved to another great perch to pose for some more stunning shots. At this point I texted Mom to come out and see it. She and Susannah came out and found me. Again, I used playback to lure it back in close - and REALLY close! It swooped in and landed in a shrub less than 4 feet away from us in plain sight (with flashlights shining on it). It sat there for a minute or two while we kept silent and watched. We waited for it to fly off before going back inside. Such a neat moment!",Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,4.00,2,"",1455,2186

I could see both fly in the dark when I then called them and was able to take a few pictures with my flashlight when one landed in a tree directly in front of me. While I was calling the ESO a fairly large bird flew  directly over my head and it had the size and shape of a great horned owl. This is close to where I saw it and then  photographed it with a second GHOW. I don’t believe it was a heron as it had overall dark undersides so it was not a barn owl which to my eye also seems to have more slender and longer wings than the great horned owl. It flew in from behind me and disappeared to the south directly down along the path. However I will not report it as I really am not sure. It’s possible that I attracted it by calling the screech owl. I called the GH0W as I walked back but got no response.,Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,4.00,2,,2849,3799

The female adult was in a tree next to that one, looking down on the rest of the owls.   We believe the adults are the same ones that raised a batch of owlets in our box last year.  We saw the female back in the box about Nov 1st, and think she laid this batch of eggs at the beginning of March, when she stopped regularly appearing at the box's opening.  The eggs probably hatched at the beginning of April, and we started seeing lots of activity from the male and female at dawn and dusk, when they were likely hunting to feed the hatchlings.  An owlet was first sighted at the opening of the box on May 8th, and the owlets began to perch at the opening on May 10th.  Five days later, they fledged. Pictures will be added here when able.",Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,4.00,2,,972,1296

I thought that it was a bag of garbage at first and then realized that it might be an owl.  This was about 6:45 am.  I turned around and found the owl standing up-right on the pavement.  I pulled over and decided that I must scoop it up with a blanket and have it covered in case it was injured.  This is such a busy County Highway, if I hadn't picked it up, it would have been killed for sure.  I contacted ECO Andrew Kostuk of the NYS DEC who said that he would meet me at my workplace in Cortland, NY.  I met up with ECO Kostuk, who stated that it was good that I picked up the owl.  He took the owl to the Cornell University Veterinary Clinic to see if they could help it.  ECO Kostuk told me that Cornell said the owl was alert and that they thought that it would have a full recovery.  Hopefully, it can be released back in to the wild.  Just an update concerning this Screech Owl, I have spoken with ECO Kostuk and the Screech Owl did have a broken wing and was operated on at the Cornell University Veterinary Clinic.  The owl survived the surgery and responded well and was then taken to a certified wildlife rehabilitator.  The owl was able to make a full recovery and am happy to say was released back in to the wild.",Megascops asio,eassco1,Group,8771,,3.75,4,,3456,4608

Responded to playback before flying out of the woods into some nearby trees where it continued to call back to the recording. I slowly crept up to where it was perched and got my phone out to record it's calls. After recording it a few times I played the recording again and it flew up to a branch not more than 6 feet away from me! I decided to attempt some flash photos with my phone, assuming it would spook and fly away immediately, but it didn't move, it just sat there and stared at the light. At this point I could see that it was a beautiful red morph, and based in the higher pitched call, probably a female. I took some video of it and then decided to go get the camera. Ran all the way back to the house and all the way back out to the spot (apparently I haven't learned to always bring the camera with me). When I returned, I played the recording again to relocate it. Sure enough, within a few seconds it emerged from it's hiding spot and flew right up to a nearby tree in the open. This time I was ready and snapped some killer shots! It moved to another great perch to pose for some more stunning shots. At this point I texted Mom to come out and see it. She and Susannah came out and found me. Again, I used playback to lure it back in close - and REALLY close! It swooped in and landed in a shrub less than 4 feet away from us in plain sight (with flashlights shining on it). It sat there for a minute or two while we kept silent and watched. We waited for it to fly off before going back inside. Such a neat moment!",Megascops asio,easowl1,Species,8770,,4.00,2,"",1863,2798

The female adult was in a tree next to that one, looking down on the rest of the owls.   We believe the adults are the same ones that raised a batch of owlets in our box last year.  We saw the female back in the box about Nov 1st, and think she laid this batch of eggs at the beginning of March, when she stopped regularly appearing at the box's opening.  The eggs probably hatched at the beginning of April, and we started seeing lots of activity from the male and female at dawn and dusk, when they were likely hunting to feed the hatchlings.  An owlet was first sighted at the opening of the box on May 8th, and the owlets began to perch at the opening on May 10th.
