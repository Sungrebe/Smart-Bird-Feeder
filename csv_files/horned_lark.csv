Here I snuck below the shingle ridge and crawled along the beach where I managed some reasonable shots at 20 m range.

One bird hovered high over the mostly bare field for several minutes and was very vocal.  He kept climbing higher and often held his wings out and glided in place with the headwind keeping him aloft.  He then dropped like a dart back to the ground and I lost him until I saw him land somewhat close to where I stood. He remained very vocal on the ground.
