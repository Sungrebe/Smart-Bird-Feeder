Two others were within 2 feet, but in cover, and the sixth was 45 yards away and well-hidden. These three had been well-hidden from dawn until early afternoon when one of the monsoonal showers approached and it got very dark, which caused the babies and Mom to leave their roosts, begin calling and Mom start feeding them again. The babies then remained exposed as is evident in the photo until the Cooper's Hawk found them near dusk.",Megascops kennicottii,wesowl1,Species,8759,,4.83,12,,2667,3015

Five separate pairs were carefully detected this evening, and I quite possibly had at least one additional bird, but had to play it conservatively. There was a point where I heard 4 birds vocalize within the span of 5-10 seconds. Conditions were quite good, it was peak time for vocalizing WESOs, and I put in more than 2 hours of effort quite late in the evening (starting 2+ hours post-sunset) when these owls are most likely more vocal. Yes, they will often call earlier in the night (and even somewhat occasionally during the day), but in my experience later in the night only increases the call frequency. I've been told there are papers that support this fact. In my opinion, cloudiness and moon phase have little effect on vocalization frequency of owls. Time of year, wind, precipitation, and temperature (the warmer the better) are the conditions to pay attention to (probably in an order something like that).   I was quite patient with each singing male to confirm that there was a female present as well, as she would vocalize much less frequently. Amazingly, every male was paired up. It was also notable to me that it appeared like a few of the territories abutted another pair's territory, which also caused me to take more time to make sure they weren't flying back and forth. If I didn't know better I would have assumed this species was common in the Seward area in proper habitat. I have certainly gotten the impression from old school Alaska birders that WESOs are believed to be increasing in the state, so perhaps this is another data point in that trend.  Curiously, no other owls were heard tonight. It sure seems like NSWOs have an earlier breeding cycle in this region and they are probably incubating (maybe even feeding young?) right now--which leads to considerably less frequent singing. I had several singing in this area more than a month ago.   If there are any birders looking for advice with this species, feel free to email me at: sulli.gibson@gmail.com",Megascops kennicottii,wesowl1,Species,8759,,4.80,5,,1365,2048

This is Daddy, who has become very flexible with his day-roosting as his babies get closer to fledging from their box in two weeks or so. (Mom remains in the box with them). My boy stayed there through mobbing by robins, chickadees, a Ruby-crowned Kinglet, a Warbling Vireo, House Finches and a Lazuli Bunting. But when a magpie discovered him, he took off and flew 50 yards across the yard to his safe place, the nest box he roosts in most frequently. Unbelievably, in late morning I looked out and saw him on the same branch again. This time, I noticed how intensely he was watching under one of my feeders ... and could it be ... was he ... yes! He was hunting the rat babies of the family that I haven't yet been able to dispatch as they foraged for spilled seed under the feeder. And then he dived off the branch toward the spot! Unfortunately, he missed, but now I know he's trying and needs to hunt during the day, so I'll be putting peanut butter out in the yard in an open spot near the rock wall where the rats run when disturbed.

Five separate pairs were carefully detected this evening, and I quite possibly had at least one additional bird, but had to play it conservatively. There was a point where I heard 4 birds vocalize within the span of 5-10 seconds. Conditions were quite good, it was peak time for vocalizing WESOs, and I put in more than 2 hours of effort quite late in the evening (starting 2+ hours post-sunset) when these owls are most likely more vocal. Yes, they will often call earlier in the night (and even somewhat occasionally during the day), but in my experience later in the night only increases the call frequency. I've been told there are papers that support this fact. In my opinion, cloudiness and moon phase have little effect on vocalization frequency of owls. Time of year, wind, precipitation, and temperature (the warmer the better) are the conditions to pay attention to (probably in an order something like that).   I was quite patient with each singing male to confirm that there was a female present as well, as she would vocalize much less frequently. Amazingly, every male was paired up. It was also notable to me that it appeared like a few of the territories abutted another pair's territory, which also caused me to take more time to make sure they weren't flying back and forth. If I didn't know better I would have assumed this species was common in the Seward area in proper habitat. I have certainly gotten the impression from old school Alaska birders that WESOs are believed to be increasing in the state, so perhaps this is another data point in that trend.  Curiously, no other owls were heard tonight. It sure seems like NSWOs have an earlier breeding cycle in this region and they are probably incubating (maybe even feeding young?) right now--which leads to considerably less frequent singing. I had several singing in this area more than a month ago.   If there are any birders looking for advice with this species, feel free to email me at: sulli.gibson@gmail.com",Megascops kennicottii,wesowl1,Species,8759,,4.29,7,,1365,2048

Five separate pairs were carefully detected this evening, and I quite possibly had at least one additional bird, but had to play it conservatively. There was a point where I heard 4 birds vocalize within the span of 5-10 seconds. Conditions were quite good, it was peak time for vocalizing WESOs, and I put in more than 2 hours of effort quite late in the evening (starting 2+ hours post-sunset) when these owls are most likely more vocal. Yes, they will often call earlier in the night (and even somewhat occasionally during the day), but in my experience later in the night only increases the call frequency. I've been told there are papers that support this fact. In my opinion, cloudiness and moon phase have little effect on vocalization frequency of owls. Time of year, wind, precipitation, and temperature (the warmer the better) are the conditions to pay attention to (probably in an order something like that).   I was quite patient with each singing male to confirm that there was a female present as well, as she would vocalize much less frequently. Amazingly, every male was paired up. It was also notable to me that it appeared like a few of the territories abutted another pair's territory, which also caused me to take more time to make sure they weren't flying back and forth. If I didn't know better I would have assumed this species was common in the Seward area in proper habitat. I have certainly gotten the impression from old school Alaska birders that WESOs are believed to be increasing in the state, so perhaps this is another data point in that trend.  Curiously, no other owls were heard tonight. It sure seems like NSWOs have an earlier breeding cycle in this region and they are probably incubating (maybe even feeding young?) right now--which leads to considerably less frequent singing. I had several singing in this area more than a month ago.   If there are any birders looking for advice with this species, feel free to email me at: sulli.gibson@gmail.com",Megascops kennicottii,wesowl1,Species,8759,,4.33,6,,1365,2048

There was a point where I heard 4 birds vocalize within the span of 5-10 seconds. Conditions were quite good, it was peak time for vocalizing WESOs, and I put in more than 2 hours of effort quite late in the evening (starting 2+ hours post-sunset) when these owls are most likely more vocal. Yes, they will often call earlier in the night (and even somewhat occasionally during the day), but in my experience later in the night only increases the call frequency. I've been told there are papers that support this fact. In my opinion, cloudiness and moon phase have little effect on vocalization frequency of owls. Time of year, wind, precipitation, and temperature (the warmer the better) are the conditions to pay attention to (probably in an order something like that).   I was quite patient with each singing male to confirm that there was a female present as well, as she would vocalize much less frequently. Amazingly, every male was paired up. It was also notable to me that it appeared like a few of the territories abutted another pair's territory, which also caused me to take more time to make sure they weren't flying back and forth. If I didn't know better I would have assumed this species was common in the Seward area in proper habitat. I have certainly gotten the impression from old school Alaska birders that WESOs are believed to be increasing in the state, so perhaps this is another data point in that trend.  Curiously, no other owls were heard tonight. It sure seems like NSWOs have an earlier breeding cycle in this region and they are probably incubating (maybe even feeding young?) right now--which leads to considerably less frequent singing. I had several singing in this area more than a month ago.   If there are any birders looking for advice with this species, feel free to email me at: sulli.gibson@gmail.com",Megascops kennicottii,wesowl1,Species,8759,,4.40,5,,1365,2048

NAR person scared the bird and it flew out of the garage but later returned. I called Rebeca at Wildlife Services and Melanie Wortment to get info. Both felt the bird would do ok if doors were left open and the bird may try to hunt. Melanie offered to bring frozen mice and put in garage.

Dad was busy as always taking a couple different shady perches, and then tearing away across the open yard to his nest box just ahead of magpies and robins, later to show up somewhere else. It was weird and wonderful to see him just off the deck on a favorite branch when I was grilling dinner or taking his pic from about 20 feet away.

This is Daddy, who has become very flexible with his day-roosting as his babies get closer to fledging from their box in two weeks or so. (Mom remains in the box with them). My boy stayed there through mobbing by robins, chickadees, a Ruby-crowned Kinglet, a Warbling Vireo, House Finches and a Lazuli Bunting. But when a magpie discovered him, he took off and flew 50 yards across the yard to his safe place, the nest box he roosts in most frequently. Unbelievably, in late morning I looked out and saw him on the same branch again. This time, I noticed how intensely he was watching under one of my feeders ... and could it be ... was he ... yes! He was hunting the rat babies of the family that I haven't yet been able to dispatch as they foraged for spilled seed under the feeder. And then he dived off the branch toward the spot! Unfortunately, he missed, but now I know he's trying and needs to hunt during the day, so I'll be putting peanut butter out in the yard in an open spot near the rock wall where the rats run when disturbed. Sexed by behavior, pale bill and my boy also has a left eye problem, not as visible in these shots.",Megascops kennicottii,wesowl1,Species,8759,,5.00,2,,640,480

Owl bander Jason Sodergren came over and banded the bird and we kept it in a box until 7:45 PM when we released it in the yard. It flew off and perched for a time in an alder before flying off further into the woods.   This is the first Western Screech Owl in our yard and one of very few for Homer and the Western Kenai Peninsula.

She was roosting in a tree near the nest box in the morning with an owlet occasionally appearing at the entrance to the box--normal. Late in the afternoon, Mom was in the entrance to the nest box, and she was holding a portion of a rodent in her beak. She receded into the box and returned to the entrance four times over a 10-minute period, always with the beastie, although it appeared to get smaller with a couple of returns. This was around  4:30 p.m. In the evening around 7:15, there she was again with a portion of a rodent in her beak as she perched in the entrance. The rodent was looking rather worse for the wear with portions of entrails visible. The owl remained there until 7:53 p.m. when she emerged and flew to a neighbor's tree, perching rather openly with her rodent until 8:35 p.m. Some time around there I heard the male give a soft bouncing ball sequence and also saw him perching in another neighbor's yard. Then, the female approached the entrance to the nest box twice and attempted to transfer the rodent she'd been grasping for hours to the baby in the entrance. Both times, the transfer failed. On the third attempt, the female pushed her way all the way into the box and emerged without the critter in her beak. These pictures are all the female at 4:28 p.m., 7:22 p.m., and 7:57 p.m. I've never seen nor heard of this behavior before.",Megascops kennicottii,wesowl1,Species,8759,,5.00,1,,681,512

It took awhile this morning for the mad mob to discover this bird after I photographed it, but later, the box got mobbed by four chickadees, two juncos, three nuthatches and two kinglets.",Megascops kennicottii,wesowl1,Species,8759,,5.00,1,,646,600

They then moved to our backyard (for the 4th straight night), where we watched the silhouetted juveniles flying around and waiting for their parent to visit, while they issued their chittery juvenile begging calls. On at least one occasion the adult fed one of the juvies some small food item. The juveniles are getting noticeably more feathering and less fluffy night by night.

NAR person scared the bird and it flew out of the garage but later returned. I called Rebeca at Wildlife Services and Melanie Wortment to get info. Both felt the bird would do ok if doors were left open and the bird may try to hunt. Melanie offered to bring frozen mice and put in garage.

The average nestling period is five weeks, but they had been in the nest for at least a little over three weeks (though it's possible they might have hatched earlier without my knowledge). The heat that must have resulted from the constant sun exposure on the telephone pole must have prompted them to fledge earlier. After the big fiasco (which I won't go into right now) of trying to help the chicks, who I thought were in serious trouble, they quickly settled into their new life outside the nest.

Eventually I was able to get a recording of a quiet series of calls with the Merlin app, which I will add soon. The vocalizations were rather ambiguous, so I’m not sure what to make of this bird just yet. I will try to get more recordings this evening.  Edit: after returning in the evening (see checklist <a href=""https://ebird.org/checklist/S149097309"">https://ebird.org/checklist/S149097309</a>), I was able to refind the bird and get a recording, which was definitively that of a Western Screech-Owl.

I retrieved the right wing and lower body of the owl (all I could dislodge from the icy roadway while avoiding passing vehicles) to verify the species identification. No head was visible. That it was an owl can be seen in the photo showing the comb-like fimbriae on the leading edge of the outer primary. The belly feathers (photo also showing tail feathers and foot) have dark crossbars on a light background matching those of screech owls. Identification was further aided by referring to the USFWS Feather Atlas for WESO (https://www.fws.gov/lab/featheratlas/feather.php?Bird=WESO_primary_adult), which shows 1) the primaries and tail feathers match the pattern and coloration of the dead owl, and 2) the lengths of the dead owl’s primaries and tail feathers are very close to those in the feather atlas: 10th primary (outer) length = 10cm, 7th and 8th primary lengths = 14cm, tail feather lengths = 9cm.
