We went hoping to get diagnostic photos but failed with good spread tail shots. At this point we knew it could never be called unless the bird was in hand, measured and banded. On 12/5 Allen Chartier was able to capture and band the bird and confirmed it as an Allen’s Hummingbird. This is only the second Ohio record.

Ric Payne got several doc shots of this hummingbird in November, including a spread tail photo. After researching, studying diagrams and consulting experts, the consensus was that R5 and R4 looked appropriately thin enough for Allen’s; however, photos can be deceiving and more were needed. We went hoping to get diagnostic photos but failed with good spread tail shots. At this point we knew it could never be called unless the bird was in hand, measured and banded. On 12/5 Allen Chartier was able to capture and band the bird and confirmed it as an Allen’s Hummingbird. This is only the second Ohio record.

The bird was banded by Bruce Peterjohn on 16 Nov 2021 and determined to be a hatch year female Allen's Hummingbird.  Access Rules:  Visiting Hours:  The bird comes to the feeder all day long, however, does not seem to be on any regular schedule.  Visiting hours are restricted to 9:00 am to 3:00 pm.    Where to park:  Limited street parking.  Do not block neighbors’ driveways.   Please be respectful of parking on neighbors' lawns (do unto others.....).  Please carpool as much as possible.

Look up at the feeder(s) hanging above the deck railing.  Please stay on the driveway behind the rope barrier.  PLEASE LIMIT the group size watching for the bird to 5 people at a time.   This may mean you need to wait up at the top of the driveway until someone ahead of you leaves.   Please add these rules to the description of the bird in all eBird reports.   Thank you, Steve and Diane Freebery",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,5.00,5,,2255,3006

Fairly quickly I ascertained when seeing the bird upon arrival that this was a HY male Rufous/Allen's. We caught the bird for banding within 5 minutes of Peter Bridge setting up the trap.

R2 did not appear exceptionally narrow. But both Kelly Bryan and Sheri Williamson concur that the shape of R2 is within the variation for Allen's. Third, I was struck by the short tail measurement. Measurements are as follows: Wing 40.89 mm, Tail 23.6 mm, Culmen 17.06 mm, weight 3.93 g. R5 which is a difficult measurement to obtain without removal of the feather from the bird was measured by two methods. Measurement by laying the feather on the ruler came in just under 2mm, estimated at 1.9 mm. Measurement of r5 with the calipers which is more difficult to do with the feather on the bird was 2.12mm. I consider this second R5 width measurement to be over-generous to the true width of that feather. Regardless both measurements are in range and point to Allen's Hummingbird (1.6-2.5 mm Pyle, Stiles) versus RUHU (2.7-3.7 mm Pyle, 2.7-3.6 Stiles). Size index (SI), a combination of wing+tail+culmen, developed by Kelly B. Bryan from his West Texas Data set to improve separation of of similar species with statistical significance also points to this bird being comfortably in range for HY male Allen's at an SI of 81.55. SI mean for Allen's is 80,45, range 75.11-83.49; SI mean for HY male Rufous is 85.25, range 80.69-90.28. Fat on this bird was scored as 1.

Would definitely appreciate others opinions considering I didn't get any great tail spreads, but the one decent pic shows very thin and lanceolate R2? without any noticable notching. It's difficult to tell if that feather is actually R2 or 3 It shows the typical pattern of an R2 feather, with no noticeable white on the tip. However, feather placement in the series of photos makes it difficult to determine if there are actually 3 feathers past it. R5 seems very thin in the photos, also suggesting Allen's.

Homeowner Pam Lehnherr reports the bird was at least present the day before Thanksgiving. She confirmed she had photos on phone dating back to Dec 6. Reports she had limited storage and had deleted the earlier photos. I expected to find a Rufous which is the most common late season hummingbird in Wisconsin. Fairly quickly I ascertained when seeing the bird upon arrival that this was a HY male Rufous/Allen's. We caught the bird for banding within 5 minutes of Peter Bridge setting up the trap. Once in hand I was immediately struck by the narrow appearance of the outer two rectrices. Secondly I did not observe a notch on the outer vane of R2 which I expected should be more salient if this was a HY male Rufous. Note the appearance of R2 can be quite variable. R2 did not appear exceptionally narrow. But both Kelly Bryan and Sheri Williamson concur that the shape of R2 is within the variation for Allen's. Third, I was struck by the short tail measurement. Measurements are as follows: Wing 40.89 mm, Tail 23.6 mm, Culmen 17.06 mm, weight 3.93 g. R5 which is a difficult measurement to obtain without removal of the feather from the bird was measured by two methods. Measurement by laying the feather on the ruler came in just under 2mm, estimated at 1.9 mm. Measurement of r5 with the calipers which is more difficult to do with the feather on the bird was 2.12mm. I consider this second R5 width measurement to be over-generous to the true width of that feather. Regardless both measurements are in range and point to Allen's Hummingbird (1.6-2.5 mm Pyle, Stiles) versus RUHU (2.7-3.7 mm Pyle, 2.7-3.6 Stiles). Size index (SI), a combination of wing+tail+culmen, developed by Kelly B. Bryan from his West Texas Data set to improve separation of of similar species with statistical significance also points to this bird being comfortably in range for HY male Allen's at an SI of 81.55. SI mean for Allen's is 80,45, range 75.11-83.49; SI mean for HY male Rufous is 85.25, range 80.69-90.28. Fat on this bird was scored as 1. No pin feathers or sheathing were noted on its wing, tail or body feathers. The inner primaries 1-5 were fresh and recently grown in as were some of the wing coverts. The tail had moderate wear on the tips. The bird was released in good health. He continued to feed and remained in the banding area while we watched him and packed the banding gear.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.29,7,"",1685,2106

Outer tail feathers (R4& R5) cannot be seen clearly but appear to be narrow. Not sure it has all 10 retrices at the moment.

Homeowner Pam Lehnherr reports the bird was at least present the day before Thanksgiving. She confirmed she had photos on phone dating back to Dec 6. Reports she had limited storage and had deleted the earlier photos. I expected to find a Rufous which is the most common late season hummingbird in Wisconsin. Fairly quickly I ascertained when seeing the bird upon arrival that this was a HY male Rufous/Allen's. We caught the bird for banding within 5 minutes of Peter Bridge setting up the trap. Once in hand I was immediately struck by the narrow appearance of the outer two rectrices. Secondly I did not observe a notch on the outer vane of R2 which I expected should be more salient if this was a HY male Rufous. Note the appearance of R2 can be quite variable. R2 did not appear exceptionally narrow. But both Kelly Bryan and Sheri Williamson concur that the shape of R2 is within the variation for Allen's. Third, I was struck by the short tail measurement. Measurements are as follows: Wing 40.89 mm, Tail 23.6 mm, Culmen 17.06 mm, weight 3.93 g. R5 which is a difficult measurement to obtain without removal of the feather from the bird was measured by two methods. Measurement by laying the feather on the ruler came in just under 2mm, estimated at 1.9 mm. Measurement of r5 with the calipers which is more difficult to do with the feather on the bird was 2.12mm. I consider this second R5 width measurement to be over-generous to the true width of that feather. Regardless both measurements are in range and point to Allen's Hummingbird (1.6-2.5 mm Pyle, Stiles) versus RUHU (2.7-3.7 mm Pyle, 2.7-3.6 Stiles). Size index (SI), a combination of wing+tail+culmen, developed by Kelly B. Bryan from his West Texas Data set to improve separation of of similar species with statistical significance also points to this bird being comfortably in range for HY male Allen's at an SI of 81.55. SI mean for Allen's is 80,45, range 75.11-83.49; SI mean for HY male Rufous is 85.25, range 80.69-90.28. Fat on this bird was scored as 1. No pin feathers or sheathing were noted on its wing, tail or body feathers. The inner primaries 1-5 were fresh and recently grown in as were some of the wing coverts. The tail had moderate wear on the tips. The bird was released in good health. He continued to feed and remained in the banding area while we watched him and packed the banding gear.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.40,5,,1418,1773

Rufous-type hummer, first discovered by Evelyn Lovitz in her garden earlier this morning. Worn imm male; age/sex determined by female-type plumage aspect with extensive rufous rump and base of tail (bases to r1), directly abutting black tail tip. Also, heavily stippled throat all the way to chin made up of neatly arranged spots with even pale fringing, all indicate imm male. Several features indicate Allen's, most importantly, very narrow rectrices (whole folded tail looks narrow) with lanceolate r2 showing no notch, and very slim r5. Also, this bird is quite worn, more so than a Rufous would normally be at this date, but appropriate for the earlier breeding phenology of Allen's. There are a good number of fresh feathers coming in around the head and body, including rufous feathers on the cheeks and flanks, and green feathers on the back and nape (appropriate for adult male Allen's). A particularly large splotch of reflective orange gorget feathers may also include some new feathers. No evidence of primary molt.

Visiting hours are restricted to 9:00 am to 3:00 pm.  Where to park: Limited street parking. Do not block neighbors’ driveways. Please be respectful of parking on neighbors' lawns (do unto others.....). Please carpool as much as possible. For those who don’t mind walking, you can help alleviate parking issues by parking in Liberty Plaza where Outback Steakhouse is.

Look up at the feeder(s) hanging above the deck railing. Please stay on the driveway behind the rope barrier.  PLEASE LIMIT the group size watching for the bird to 5 people at a time. This may mean you need to wait up at the top of the driveway until someone ahead of you leaves.  Please add these rules to the description of the bird in all eBird reports.  Thank you, Steve and Diane Freebery""",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.20,5,,1728,2136

Homeowner Pam Lehnherr reports the bird was at least present the day before Thanksgiving. She confirmed she had photos on phone dating back to Dec 6. Reports she had limited storage and had deleted the earlier photos. I expected to find a Rufous which is the most common late season hummingbird in Wisconsin. Fairly quickly I ascertained when seeing the bird upon arrival that this was a HY male Rufous/Allen's. We caught the bird for banding within 5 minutes of Peter Bridge setting up the trap. Once in hand I was immediately struck by the narrow appearance of the outer two rectrices. Secondly I did not observe a notch on the outer vane of R2 which I expected should be more salient if this was a HY male Rufous. Note the appearance of R2 can be quite variable. R2 did not appear exceptionally narrow. But both Kelly Bryan and Sheri Williamson concur that the shape of R2 is within the variation for Allen's. Third, I was struck by the short tail measurement. Measurements are as follows: Wing 40.89 mm, Tail 23.6 mm, Culmen 17.06 mm, weight 3.93 g. R5 which is a difficult measurement to obtain without removal of the feather from the bird was measured by two methods. Measurement by laying the feather on the ruler came in just under 2mm, estimated at 1.9 mm. Measurement of r5 with the calipers which is more difficult to do with the feather on the bird was 2.12mm. I consider this second R5 width measurement to be over-generous to the true width of that feather. Regardless both measurements are in range and point to Allen's Hummingbird (1.6-2.5 mm Pyle, Stiles) versus RUHU (2.7-3.7 mm Pyle, 2.7-3.6 Stiles). Size index (SI), a combination of wing+tail+culmen, developed by Kelly B. Bryan from his West Texas Data set to improve separation of of similar species with statistical significance also points to this bird being comfortably in range for HY male Allen's at an SI of 81.55. SI mean for Allen's is 80,45, range 75.11-83.49; SI mean for HY male Rufous is 85.25, range 80.69-90.28. Fat on this bird was scored as 1. No pin feathers or sheathing were noted on its wing, tail or body feathers. The inner primaries 1-5 were fresh and recently grown in as were some of the wing coverts. The tail had moderate wear on the tips. The bird was released in good health. He continued to feed and remained in the banding area while we watched him and packed the banding gear.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.20,5,In-hand,3442,4302

Measurement by laying the feather on the ruler came in just under 2mm, estimated at 1.9 mm. Measurement of r5 with the calipers which is more difficult to do with the feather on the bird was 2.12mm. I consider this second R5 width measurement to be over-generous to the true width of that feather. Regardless both measurements are in range and point to Allen's Hummingbird (1.6-2.5 mm Pyle, Stiles) versus RUHU (2.7-3.7 mm Pyle, 2.7-3.6 Stiles). Size index (SI), a combination of wing+tail+culmen, developed by Kelly B. Bryan from his West Texas Data set to improve separation of of similar species with statistical significance also points to this bird being comfortably in range for HY male Allen's at an SI of 81.55. SI mean for Allen's is 80,45, range 75.11-83.49; SI mean for HY male Rufous is 85.25, range 80.69-90.28. Fat on this bird was scored as 1. No pin feathers or sheathing were noted on its wing, tail or body feathers. The inner primaries 1-5 were fresh and recently grown in as were some of the wing coverts. The tail had moderate wear on the tips. The bird was released in good health. He continued to feed and remained in the banding area while we watched him and packed the banding gear.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.00,6,,955,1195

She is ""hoping people  will want to come look..."" She prefers texts at (608) 206-0187 to  request information about visiting. For those without that technology, I  expect she would not mind a phone call. The area behind Pam's place for  viewing the bird is smaller so visits will likely need to be staggered  throughout the day. Please be mindful of following pandemic precautions  and giving the bird adequate distance to go about his feeding routine  uninterrupted. I recommend trying to limit the time you are there to an  hour to allow the opportunity for others to safely see the bird.

Ric Payne got several doc shots of this hummingbird in November, including a spread tail photo. After researching, studying diagrams and consulting experts, the consensus was that R5 and R4 looked appropriately thin enough for Allen’s; however, photos can be deceiving and more were needed. We went hoping to get diagnostic photos but failed with good spread tail shots. At this point we knew it could never be called unless the bird was in hand, measured and banded. On 12/5 Allen Chartier was able to capture and band the bird and confirmed it as an Allen’s Hummingbird. This is only the second Ohio record.

Homeowner Pam Lehnherr reports the bird was at least present the day before Thanksgiving. She confirmed she had photos on phone dating back to Dec 6. Reports she had limited storage and had deleted the earlier photos. I expected to find a Rufous which is the most common late season hummingbird in Wisconsin. Fairly quickly I ascertained when seeing the bird upon arrival that this was a HY male Rufous/Allen's. We caught the bird for banding within 5 minutes of Peter Bridge setting up the trap. Once in hand I was immediately struck by the narrow appearance of the outer two rectrices. Secondly I did not observe a notch on the outer vane of R2 which I expected should be more salient if this was a HY male Rufous. Note the appearance of R2 can be quite variable. R2 did not appear exceptionally narrow. But both Kelly Bryan and Sheri Williamson concur that the shape of R2 is within the variation for Allen's. Third, I was struck by the short tail measurement. Measurements are as follows: Wing 40.89 mm, Tail 23.6 mm, Culmen 17.06 mm, weight 3.93 g. R5 which is a difficult measurement to obtain without removal of the feather from the bird was measured by two methods. Measurement by laying the feather on the ruler came in just under 2mm, estimated at 1.9 mm. Measurement of r5 with the calipers which is more difficult to do with the feather on the bird was 2.12mm. I consider this second R5 width measurement to be over-generous to the true width of that feather. Regardless both measurements are in range and point to Allen's Hummingbird (1.6-2.5 mm Pyle, Stiles) versus RUHU (2.7-3.7 mm Pyle, 2.7-3.6 Stiles). Size index (SI), a combination of wing+tail+culmen, developed by Kelly B. Bryan from his West Texas Data set to improve separation of of similar species with statistical significance also points to this bird being comfortably in range for HY male Allen's at an SI of 81.55. SI mean for Allen's is 80,45, range 75.11-83.49; SI mean for HY male Rufous is 85.25, range 80.69-90.28. Fat on this bird was scored as 1. No pin feathers or sheathing were noted on its wing, tail or body feathers. The inner primaries 1-5 were fresh and recently grown in as were some of the wing coverts. The tail had moderate wear on the tips. The bird was released in good health. He continued to feed and remained in the banding area while we watched him and packed the banding gear.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.00,5,,1815,2269

Marantz on 13 October 2017 along lower Arroyo Grande Creek, Oceano, San Luis Obispo County, California.","We saw in association with the stand of red-flowering plants on the north side of the creek one adult male Allen’s Hummingbird and a second female or immature male Selasphorus.  Given that the male was in the same place and behaving in the same manner as a bird that I saw here in mid-September I assume it is likely to winter here.  After getting the call that the catbird had been refound we curt short our observations of these hummingbirds. The male was seen relatively well and heard giving both calls and wing-trills, but the second bird, which was also calling, was seen insufficiently to distinguish between a young male and a female.  Both birds were relatively small hummingbirds with plump-bodies, a hunch-backed posture and long, tubular bills.  On the male I noted and my photos show that the gorget was complete and iridescent red in color, that the crown and upper back were a deep, iridescent green, and that the rump, flanks, sides of the face were rufous.  I was less sure if the scapulars were rufous or green and I never saw the tail clearly.  The breast was white and I think this same color extended down the center of the belly. The second bird had a mostly white throat, but also some iridescent red in the center, lower part.  This bird was more extensively white below, but also with rufous flanks.  As I recall the face had some rufous but the back was green and I never clearly saw the rump or upperside of the tail.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,3.83,6,,1142,1684

Continuing female.  First arrived at 11:53 and fed at the feeder above.  Arrived again at 12:27 and fed at the feeder at ground-level.  Access Rules: Visiting Hours: The bird comes to the feeder all day long, however, does not seem to be on any regular schedule. Visiting hours are restricted to 9:00 am to 3:00 pm.  Where to park: Limited street parking. Do not block neighbors’ driveways. Please be respectful of parking on neighbors' lawns (do unto others.....). Please carpool as much as possible. For those who don’t mind walking, you can help alleviate parking issues by parking in Liberty Plaza where Outback Steakhouse is. It is a half mile walk from there.  Address: 257 Delaplane Ave., Newark, DE 19711 Hosts: Diane and Steve Freebery  It is not necessary to contact us prior to coming.  No restroom facilities available.  How to view the bird: Walk to the bottom of the driveway at the south side of the house. Look up at the feeder(s) hanging above the deck railing. Please stay on the driveway behind the rope barrier.  PLEASE LIMIT the group size watching for the bird to 5 people at a time. This may mean you need to wait up at the top of the driveway until someone ahead of you leaves.  Please add these rules to the description of the bird in all eBird reports.  Thank you, Steve and Diane Freebery""",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.33,3,,1692,2265

Homeowner Pam Lehnherr reports the bird was at least present the day before Thanksgiving. She confirmed she had photos on phone dating back to Dec 6. Reports she had limited storage and had deleted the earlier photos. I expected to find a Rufous which is the most common late season hummingbird in Wisconsin. Fairly quickly I ascertained when seeing the bird upon arrival that this was a HY male Rufous/Allen's. We caught the bird for banding within 5 minutes of Peter Bridge setting up the trap. Once in hand I was immediately struck by the narrow appearance of the outer two rectrices. Secondly I did not observe a notch on the outer vane of R2 which I expected should be more salient if this was a HY male Rufous. Note the appearance of R2 can be quite variable. R2 did not appear exceptionally narrow. But both Kelly Bryan and Sheri Williamson concur that the shape of R2 is within the variation for Allen's. Third, I was struck by the short tail measurement. Measurements are as follows: Wing 40.89 mm, Tail 23.6 mm, Culmen 17.06 mm, weight 3.93 g. R5 which is a difficult measurement to obtain without removal of the feather from the bird was measured by two methods. Measurement by laying the feather on the ruler came in just under 2mm, estimated at 1.9 mm. Measurement of r5 with the calipers which is more difficult to do with the feather on the bird was 2.12mm. I consider this second R5 width measurement to be over-generous to the true width of that feather. Regardless both measurements are in range and point to Allen's Hummingbird (1.6-2.5 mm Pyle, Stiles) versus RUHU (2.7-3.7 mm Pyle, 2.7-3.6 Stiles). Size index (SI), a combination of wing+tail+culmen, developed by Kelly B. Bryan from his West Texas Data set to improve separation of of similar species with statistical significance also points to this bird being comfortably in range for HY male Allen's at an SI of 81.55. SI mean for Allen's is 80,45, range 75.11-83.49; SI mean for HY male Rufous is 85.25, range 80.69-90.28. Fat on this bird was scored as 1. No pin feathers or sheathing were noted on its wing, tail or body feathers. The inner primaries 1-5 were fresh and recently grown in as were some of the wing coverts. The tail had moderate wear on the tips. The bird was released in good health. He continued to feed and remained in the banding area while we watched him and packed the banding gear.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.00,4,,1608,2009

Unfortunately, the bird never displayed but the date and location suggests this bird could be breeding locally. A female selasphorus was also spotted which could potentially be his mate.

Green back on a male selasphorus is often the hallmark of Allen's.  This bird is green-backed, but subadult male Rufous can also have green back in the fall, with more rufous on the top of the head, neck and edges of the back than an Allen's. The crown on this bird is dark grayish, arguing for Allen's.  Looking at the tail feathers in my photo 573A5366-3 below, there may be extremely slight notching but this extremely slight notching is still in line with Allen's reference photos on Sheri Williamson's  flickr site, reference noted below.  Tena Gardiner's better tail photo taken simultaneously next to us seems to nail it as an Allen's, as compared with the references on Sheri Williamson's flickr Allen's gallery, which is the strongest evidence.  The outer tail feather in my profile flight photo below also seems pinnate, arguing for Allen's.  We are told that the timing of the gorget moult is also consistent with Allen's.     Reference Footnote:  See Sheri-Williamson's Flickr Allen's Gallery and note the Huntington Beach California Allen's photo by Eric Lu (x73-3584-1 unambiguous Allen's)..R2 has a slight indentation and all the tail feathers seem identical in shape to everyone's photos of this Houston bird.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.50,2,,3000,2400

When the jay flew away the fledglings then became visible as well as other birds. At one point one of the fledglings got too close to the other and they physically got into a tussle and flew vertically several times.

Need I say these have both been confirmed?   We expected a hard freeze last night so I took in the feeders to keep them liquid. Just before 7:00 this morning I took them back out. It was 33d so not as cold as expected. Still, as I was hanging one of them I heard Mr A impatiently waiting in the magnolia above me. By the time I got back inside the house I noted (and identified) the bird at the feeder.  Bird A has iridescent gorget feathers on the sides of its throat and a small number of darker feathers on the central throat. Note also that Mr A has a wash of light feathers on either side of his lower back. Lancelate tail feathers, narrow R5 and green back, see diagnostic photo 20 Dec, S99191485. Mr A visit: 8:26, 8:39, 8:47, 9:12, 9:29, 9:53, 10:12, 10:30, 10:47, 10:52, 11:01, 11:25. 12 visits over 179 minutes for an average of 16 minutes between visits.  Bird B is my original Allen's. It has no iridescent side feathers and a fairly large patch on its central throat. Lancelate tail feathers, narrow R5 and green back, see diagnostic photo 15 Dec, S98935894.

This is first day sighted.  I want to give credit to Kelly Bryan on this ID.  Kelly Bryan  To:Kay Zagst Cc:Johana Huff Thu, Sep 10 at 4:47 PM Johana and Kay,  Well, first of all it is not a juvenile bird.  Second, it is a female.  So, you ask me why?  This bird is not in fresh juvenile plumage.  It is in old faded, worn plumage.  Note that the tips of several tail feathers are worn and that the flight feathers are faded brown, evidence that they are almost a year old now.  The 50% green central tail feathers make it a female, an older one due to the amount of rufous at the base.  A juvenile female Rufous/Allen's would have a 100% green central tail feathers.  So, it comes down to the shape of the tail feathers, especially R2s and R5s to determine Rufous/Allen's.  If I had this bird in my hand to band and the tail length measurement was less that 26mm and the R5s were less than 2.8mm, it would be an Allen's.  The shape of the R2s and R5s look good to me based on the excellent tail spread photo.  R5s appear narrow and the R2s are not overly wide and without an indentation (notch) in the outer web near the tip of the feather.  So, that is my evaluation, not 100% sure but dang close!

Also checklist views in eBird can sometimes chop the ends off of long photos and one can’t see the whole photo unless you actually “open” that photo fully by double-clicking or tapping, etc.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.50,2,,927,554

Nonetheless, this bird did have an entirely green upper back, extending down through the center back, only changing to rufous in the lower back where it transitions to the rump and upper tail coverts. •	There are two clincher marks to separate adult male Rufous from Allen’s: 1.	Narrow outer tail feathers – we feel this bird had very narrow R3, R4, and R5. The photo below shows the two widest central R1 feathers, with R2 on either side, then R3 appears, R4, and R5 are nearly all stacked on top of each other, though the shafts are visible at their bases. 2.	Allen’s lacks the notched R2 shown on the inner web of R2 on Rufous. The photographs of this bird show tapered, unnotched inner-webs of R2. •	Timing – Allen’s are known to migrate earlier in spring than Rufous, often Jan-March, before Rufous are expected in Inyo with the earliest Rufous spring migrants arriving the first week of March.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.50,2,,1864,1864

Sat on the vines above the lower level feeder, up in the trees and eventually made it to the feeder. Very Access Rules: Visiting Hours: The bird comes to the feeder all day long, however, does not seem to be on any regular schedule. Visiting hours are restricted to 9:00 am to 3:00 pm.  Where to park: Limited street parking. Do not block neighbors’ driveways. Please be respectful of parking on neighbors' lawns (do unto others.....). Please carpool as much as possible. For those who don’t mind walking, you can help alleviate parking issues by parking in Liberty Plaza where Outback Steakhouse is. It is a half mile walk from there.  Address: 257 Delaplane Ave., Newark, DE 19711 Hosts: Diane and Steve Freebery  It is not necessary to contact us prior to coming.  No restroom facilities available.  How to view the bird: Walk to the bottom of the driveway at the south side of the house. Look up at the feeder(s) hanging above the deck railing. Please stay on the driveway behind the rope barrier.  PLEASE LIMIT the group size watching for the bird to 5 people at a time. This may mean you need to wait up at the top of the driveway until someone ahead of you leaves.  Please add these rules to the description of the bird in all eBird reports.  Thank you, Steve and Diane Freebery""",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,3.67,3,,2178,3937

If there is a notch of p2 it's very slight. P5 appears to have a spike. Bird in question also has green upper back with rufous along rump and tail, noted when feeding. Also have multiple recordings of believed  Allen's and Rufous; maybe they can be distinguished by further review of graph. Merlin, which I don't frequently trust on questionable birds, did pick up Allen's multiple times throughout 2 hour visit.  At the site, were at least 3 rufous hummingbirds of different ages as well.

Although I was able to capture some tail fan photos, R2 was not distinguishable in most, and I pushed the ISO to prioritize shutter speed in the low light, resulting in poor detail on the shot I do have of the tail fan.  Original: Rufous candidate, looking through photos later to see if I have any tail fan photos.

Its lancelet shape with an acute point at the tip, and lack of any ""notch"" near the tip on the outside web, and slim dark stripe along the quill eliminate Rufous.

The green feathers also run along the side of the back just above the top of the wings.    The hummingbird is an adult male with a complete gorget.  The tips of the wings are in poor condition and it is missing all but about three tail feathers.  10-3-22  After reviewing photos and a couple of online sources I believe the tail feather on the left of the photo is the R2 and it is narrow like an Allen’s and not notched like a Rufous.  If this is the case then this is an Allen's Hummingbird.  Note:  I was corrected by Harlan Stewart on the tail feathers.

Visiting hours are restricted to 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. Where to park: Limited street parking. Do not block neighbors’ driveways. Please be respectful of parking on neighbors' lawns (do unto others.....). Please carpool as much as possible.

Look up at the feeder(s) hanging above the deck railing. Please stay on the driveway behind the rope barrier.  PLEASE LIMIT the group size watching for the bird to 5 people at a time. This may mean you need to wait up at the top of the driveway until someone ahead of you leaves.   Please add these rules to the description of the bird in all eBird reports.  Thank you, Steve and Diane Freebery 257 Delaplane Av Newark, DE 19711",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,3.33,3,,1060,2048

Green back on a male selasphorus is often the hallmark of Allen's.  This bird is green-backed, but subadult male Rufous can also have green back in the fall, with more rufous on the top of the head, neck and edges of the back than an Allen's. The crown on this bird is dark grayish, arguing for Allen's.  Looking at the tail feathers in my photo 573A5366-3 below, there may be extremely slight notching but this extremely slight notching is still in line with Allen's reference photos on Sheri Williamson's  flickr site, reference noted below.  Tena Gardiner's better tail photo taken simultaneously next to us seems to nail it as an Allen's, as compared with the references on Sheri Williamson's flickr Allen's gallery, which is the strongest evidence.

I think these two have been here a week, and today I got some photos showing tail pattern of one bright juv. It is a juv female: note the juv-patterned throat, the lack of indentation on R2, the broad band of green separating rufous base from the black tip on R1, and the relatively narrow R5; also extensively rufous rump. Not all those characters are diagnostic but together should be. Based on the literature and our experience in the yard, I think that during the first 2 weeks of July, the juvs are (almost) always Allen's while the adults are (almost) always Rufous but after mid-July the appearance of juv Rufous and fewer adults complicate matters, and then in August the juv Rufous will be heavily dominate with Allen's essentially disappearing by mid-August. UPDATE: Sheri Williamson has put this back in our queue as an adult female Allen's. This is the first time I've had anyone ask an observer to amend a age/sex designation, but I'm happy to change the photo to ""adult female Allen's.""",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,5.00,1,,1600,2259

Rufous-type hummer, first discovered by Evelyn Lovitz in her garden earlier this morning. Worn imm male; age/sex determined by female-type plumage aspect with extensive rufous rump and base of tail (bases to r1), directly abutting black tail tip. Also, heavily stippled throat all the way to chin made up of neatly arranged spots with even pale fringing, all indicate imm male. Several features indicate Allen's, most importantly, very narrow rectrices (whole folded tail looks narrow) with lanceolate r2 showing no notch, and very slim r5. Also, this bird is quite worn, more so than a Rufous would normally be at this date, but appropriate for the earlier breeding phenology of Allen's. There are a good number of fresh feathers coming in around the head and body, including rufous feathers on the cheeks and flanks, and green feathers on the back and nape (appropriate for adult male Allen's). A particularly large splotch of reflective orange gorget feathers may also include some new feathers. No evidence of primary molt. Defending garden from nearby Ruby-throats; ""zeee-chupity-chup"" chase call sounds very much like Rufous.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,3.50,2,,1363,2048

The bird is at a private residence, please follow guidelines below for visitation. Many thanks to Diane & Steve! Access Rules:  Visiting Hours: The bird comes to the feeder all day long, however, does not seem to be on any regular schedule. Visiting hours are restricted to 9:00 am to 3:00 pm.   Where to park: Limited street parking. Do not block neighbors’ driveways. Please be respectful of parking on neighbors' lawns (do unto others.....). Please carpool as much as possible. For those who don’t mind walking, you can help alleviate parking issues by parking in Liberty Plaza where Outback Steakhouse is. It is a half mile walk from there.   Address: 257 Delaplane Ave., Newark, DE 19711 Hosts: Diane and Steve Freebery  It is not necessary to contact us prior to coming.  No restroom facilities available.

Thank you, Kelly.   Narrow R4 and R5.  R2 does not appear to be notched, so better for ALHU.  I would guess that this is an immature male. Green back and crown.  Bird probably came to the yard this morning.  First seen around 0830 and was present throughout the day.  Very aggressive.  At first perched in nearby tree, but, eventually, pretty much parked on the far side of the feeder.  Didn't go to flowers.  Spread its tail whenever it was chasing and/or challenging another hummer.  Started raining after 10 a.m., so only dry bird images.  Wet bird shown in my next report.  Weather was overcast and in the mid 70s all day.  Very light rain on and off  all day and expected to continue into the next day.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.00,1,,3888,5184

When the jay flew away the fledglings then became visible as well as other birds. At one point one of the fledglings got too close to the other and they physically got into a tussle and flew vertically several times.

I did not need more than fifteen seconds or so to take some shots before leaving her be. So if you do happen to find this bird, or any other nesting in the area, please be mindful of their safety and well-being and be sure (whether photographing or simply observing) never to disturb the area in any way that could endanger the nest or render it more visible to predators, to aways check that the birds/nestlings are not stressed or liable to abandon the nest, and to avoid spending too much time there lest you attract the attention of nearby predators.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.00,1,Nest,3648,5472

Unfortunately, the bird never displayed but the date and location suggests this bird could be breeding locally. A female selasphorus was also spotted which could potentially be his mate.

HY male with circa 10 reflective gorget feathers including a few large ones along the margin of the throat/gorget, green back, rufous rump, strong rufous wash on flanks, and rects largely rufous in color. Little emargination on tip of r2, very narrow r5 (1.98 mm), first generation r1 on left side already replaced. Wing: 39.38 mm; exposed culmen: 17.83 mm; tail 24 mm; striations present in the form of one long groove over one-half length of bill.

Also have multiple recordings of believed  Allen's and Rufous; maybe they can be distinguished by further review of graph. Merlin, which I don't frequently trust on questionable birds, did pick up Allen's multiple times throughout 2 hour visit.  At the site, were at least 3 rufous hummingbirds of different ages as well.

The crown on this bird is dark grayish, arguing for Allen's.  Looking at the tail feathers in my photo 573A5366-3 below, there may be extremely slight notching but this extremely slight notching is still in line with Allen's reference photos on Sheri Williamson's  flickr site, reference noted below.  Tena Gardiner's better tail photo taken simultaneously next to us seems to nail it as an Allen's, as compared with the references on Sheri Williamson's flickr Allen's gallery, which is the strongest evidence.  The outer tail feather in my profile flight photo below also seems pinnate, arguing for Allen's.  We are told that the timing of the gorget moult is also consistent with Allen's.     Reference Footnote:  See Sheri-Williamson's Flickr Allen's Gallery and note the Huntington Beach California Allen's photo by Eric Lu (x73-3584-1 unambiguous Allen's)..R2 has a slight indentation and all the tail feathers seem identical in shape to everyone's photos of this Houston bird.",Selasphorus sasin,allhum,Species,4774,,4.00,1,,3000,2400

Been here a couple of days. It’s Mid- February and it has a full gorget and no juvenile white tips to tail which this might suggest an adult male ALHU or green backed RUHU. Not too cooperative in getting tail shots - rarely flares tail even in high winds. All I got was a few really bad out of focus shots. Cannot see any significant notch in what I think is R2. Outer tail feathers (R4& R5) cannot be seen clearly but appear to be narrow. Not sure it has all 10 retrices at the moment.

Ric Payne got several doc shots of this hummingbird in November, including a spread tail photo.

We went hoping to get diagnostic photos but failed with good spread tail shots. At this point we knew it could never be called unless the bird was in hand, measured and banded. On 12/5 Allen Chartier was able to capture and band the bird and confirmed it as an Allen’s Hummingbird. This is only the second Ohio record.
