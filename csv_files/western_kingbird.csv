A pale medium-sized bird was perched atop a stick in a field, which I hoped wouldn’t be a mockingbird. It had a yellow belly, blue-gray head, a greenish back, and a thick bill. Other yellow-bellied kingbirds were ruled out due to the relatively smaller bill, gray of throat running down onto the breast, and prominent white outer vanes of the outer rectrices.   This seems like a particularly good year for Western Kingbirds in the east, as well as Tropical Kingbirds. It’s unclear if those two things are related since we aren’t confident in the source population of Tropical Kingbirds. This is the 7th record in Mass so far this fall, with others coming from Wachusett, Halifax, Wellfleet, Chatham, two from Cuttyhunk, and Manomet. New York has had eight records already, and Maine has had one.  The lack of emargination in p9-10 indicates a hatch year. A molt limit is apparent in the greater and lesser coverts in the spread-wing photo.  The exact location of the bird is in Rampart’s Field- https://goo.gl/maps/Aabv5n3JctBK1vav6. This field can be accessed by parking at the Eastern Point Lighthouse and walking the trail across the street from the Yacht Club.

A pale medium-sized bird was perched atop a stick in a field, which I hoped wouldn’t be a mockingbird. It had a yellow belly, blue-gray head, a greenish back, and a thick bill. Other yellow-bellied kingbirds were ruled out due to the relatively smaller bill, gray of throat running down onto the breast, and prominent white outer vanes of the outer rectrices.   This seems like a particularly good year for Western Kingbirds in the east, as well as Tropical Kingbirds. It’s unclear if those two things are related since we aren’t confident in the source population of Tropical Kingbirds. This is the 7th record in Mass so far this fall, with others coming from Wachusett, Halifax, Wellfleet, Chatham, two from Cuttyhunk, and Manomet. New York has had eight records already, and Maine has had one.  The lack of emargination in p9-10 indicates a hatch year. A molt limit is apparent in the greater and lesser coverts in the spread-wing photo.  The exact location of the bird is in Rampart’s Field- https://goo.gl/maps/Aabv5n3JctBK1vav6. This field can be accessed by parking at the Eastern Point Lighthouse and walking the trail across the street from the Yacht Club. It was moving all throughout the northwest side of the field (sunlit in early morning) and in the cedar trees in the field.

A pale medium-sized bird was perched atop a stick in a field, which I hoped wouldn’t be a mockingbird. It had a yellow belly, blue-gray head, a greenish back, and a thick bill. Other yellow-bellied kingbirds were ruled out due to the relatively smaller bill, gray of throat running down onto the breast, and prominent white outer vanes of the outer rectrices.   This seems like a particularly good year for Western Kingbirds in the east, as well as Tropical Kingbirds. It’s unclear if those two things are related since we aren’t confident in the source population of Tropical Kingbirds. This is the 7th record in Mass so far this fall, with others coming from Wachusett, Halifax, Wellfleet, Chatham, two from Cuttyhunk, and Manomet. New York has had eight records already, and Maine has had one.  The lack of emargination in p9-10 indicates a hatch year. A molt limit is apparent in the greater and lesser coverts in the spread-wing photo.  The exact location of the bird is in Rampart’s Field- https://goo.gl/maps/Aabv5n3JctBK1vav6. This field can be accessed by parking at the Eastern Point Lighthouse and walking the trail across the street from the Yacht Club. It was moving all throughout the northwest side of the field (sunlit in early morning) and in the cedar trees in the field. Sometimes it would sit and preen in a thicket or high up in a deciduous tree.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.33,9,,1728,2592

I doubled back to a tree where I thought I had seen an eastern phoebe earlier to see what else I could find. Bird was silent as far as I can tell but I’m not familiar with its calls and may have missed them. It was flushed from a leafless tree by mockingbirds/robin. The bird then moved to a dogwood to feed on its berries. ID information: Lemonade colored belly. Black tail with white edges . Short bill . Black legs. Gray head. Black stripe on lores. Distinguished from tropical/couch's after viewing the tail in particular as is evident in my pictures. George very helpfully pointed out that coverts look scaley and suggest the bird is juvenile. First seen at dropped pin https://goo.gl/maps/Gj7wCCRZpAGnMuH6A . Use Google maps to find the location. Relocated later with many other birders fluttering around the railroad tracks. The bird eventually disappeared across the railroad tracks after being seen on a nearby telephone wire.

Based on eBird records, this is the first WEKI reported in PG County since 16 Sep 2012 at Milltown Landing.   The bird was too light to be a CAKI, and it had a low contrast face. White edging was present on the tail, although that's not always the case with birds during this time of the year.  The WEKI was present when I arrived at 0737, staying in the same area for most of the day. Most of the time it could be found on power lines adjacent to a set of evergreen trees. It frequently flew down or flew out into the fields to catch insets, typically returning in a few minutes. Occasionally the bird would disappear just beyond a set of large trees, always returning within five minutes.  The bird was present through Saturday 10/05. No positive reports since then. Of note: Tim Carney found a WEKI along Kembo Road leading into Swan Creek (AA Co) early on 10/03, and that bird was last reported in the early afternoon.

Based on eBird records, this is the first WEKI reported in PG County since 16 Sep 2012 at Milltown Landing.   The bird was too light to be a CAKI, and it had a low contrast face. White edging was present on the tail, although that's not always the case with birds during this time of the year.  The WEKI was present when I arrived at 0737, staying in the same area for most of the day. Most of the time it could be found on power lines adjacent to a set of evergreen trees. It frequently flew down or flew out into the fields to catch insets, typically returning in a few minutes. Occasionally the bird would disappear just beyond a set of large trees, always returning within five minutes.  The bird was present through Saturday 10/05. No positive reports since then. Of note: Tim Carney found a WEKI along Kembo Road leading into Swan Creek (AA Co) early on 10/03, and that bird was last reported in the early afternoon. Could they be the same bird?  Low quality audio obtained.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,5.00,3,,2268,2835

Bird was silent as far as I can tell but I’m not familiar with its calls and may have missed them. It was flushed from a leafless tree by mockingbirds/robin. The bird then moved to a dogwood to feed on its berries. ID information: Lemonade colored belly. Black tail with white edges . Short bill . Black legs. Gray head. Black stripe on lores. Distinguished from tropical/couch's after viewing the tail in particular as is evident in my pictures. George very helpfully pointed out that coverts look scaley and suggest the bird is juvenile. First seen at dropped pin https://goo.gl/maps/Gj7wCCRZpAGnMuH6A . Use Google maps to find the location. Relocated later with many other birders fluttering around the railroad tracks. The bird eventually disappeared across the railroad tracks after being seen on a nearby telephone wire. It could be anywhere in West Philly at this point...but at any rate, I didn’t think I’d first see this bird in Philly nor that it would be the third county record.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.20,5,,960,1280

I doubled back to a tree where I thought I had seen an eastern phoebe earlier to see what else I could find. Bird was silent as far as I can tell but I’m not familiar with its calls and may have missed them. It was flushed from a leafless tree by mockingbirds/robin. The bird then moved to a dogwood to feed on its berries. ID information: Lemonade colored belly. Black tail with white edges . Short bill . Black legs. Gray head. Black stripe on lores. Distinguished from tropical/couch's after viewing the tail in particular as is evident in my pictures. George very helpfully pointed out that coverts look scaley and suggest the bird is juvenile. First seen at dropped pin https://goo.gl/maps/Gj7wCCRZpAGnMuH6A . Use Google maps to find the location. Relocated later with many other birders fluttering around the railroad tracks. The bird eventually disappeared across the railroad tracks after being seen on a nearby telephone wire. It could be anywhere in West Philly at this point...but at any rate, I didn’t think I’d first see this bird in Philly nor that it would be the third county record.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.33,3,,1440,1920

Interesting non-calling Kingbird that we just assume to be Tropical at first glance. However, narrow white edged outer rects majorly confused the issue with Western as a possibility. Bill seems not to be as long and robust as TRKI. Tail is molting with central rects appearing black and remainder somewhat brownish. More study and review of photos and other features might lead to a different conclusion than our initial submission as ""yellow bellied kingbird sp."" Conclusion did change to WEKI with the following analysis provided by Peter Pyle:   ""Fun bird, invoking thoughts of Couch's Kingbird (p10 &gt; p5 to rule out Tropical) but I just checked Macaulay and find no COKIs with white outer webs to the outer rectrices.  So it's a Western that is brighter than most we see in North America because it has molted it's body feathers, something they usually do in Mexico, and then by the time they come back up in spring they are worn and faded again.  What's of more interest to me (almost) than the species is that it's an HY that has suspended an eccentric preformative molt after replacing p4-p6. Something like the bird in Figure 2A here: https://www.birdpop.org/docs/pubs/Pyle_2021_Defining_Moults.pdf  Typically they go to the Mexican monsoon region to start this molt, suspend it for migration to southern Mexico/Central American winter grounds, and complete it there. Your bird may have gone down there at first to begin the molt abd then underwent a 180 degree migration for leg 2. Or maybe it just started the molt up here somewhere.""",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,5.00,2,,1623,1755

Have only seen Western Kingbirds. The pair have black tails edged with white which CK does not. Their beaks are not as stout or thick as a CK and the underwing is pale, perhaps light olive or light yellow, depending on the light, whereas the underwing of CK is yellow.  The Western tail is described as straight but in some poses it can be slightly notched. However the CK tail is deeply notched. The 2 appear to be a nesting pair. Observed 1 sitting in nest built on the join of a street light and power pole. It chased off a house sparrow that ventured too close. The location is exposed and there are jays in the area.

Bird had relatively small bill and white outer tail feathers (eliminating Tropical Kingbird) and was additionally pale without prominent contrast between dark grey chest and head and white throat (further eliminating Cassin's Kingbird).",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,5.00,2,,2000,3000

Farm employee George Meyers found the bird late yesterday afternoon and brought the bird to Michel Cavigelli's attention.  Based on eBird records, this is the first WEKI reported in PG County since 16 Sep 2012 at Milltown Landing.   The bird was too light to be a CAKI, and it had a low contrast face. White edging was present on the tail, although that's not always the case with birds during this time of the year.  The WEKI was present when I arrived at 0737, staying in the same area for most of the day. Most of the time it could be found on power lines adjacent to a set of evergreen trees. It frequently flew down or flew out into the fields to catch insets, typically returning in a few minutes. Occasionally the bird would disappear just beyond a set of large trees, always returning within five minutes.  The bird was present through Saturday 10/05. No positive reports since then. Of note: Tim Carney found a WEKI along Kembo Road leading into Swan Creek (AA Co) early on 10/03, and that bird was last reported in the early afternoon. Could they be the same bird?  Low quality audio obtained.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.00,3,,1802,2253

Second in the county since the one I had fly over at my house in 2016.  Beautiful kingbird with light eye-line, white throat, striking white outer rectrices, and very bright yellow underside. When I first got on it it was being quite vocal, both singing softly and giving the sharp 'kep' call. I texted my dad and got him over as fast as possible, and after losing it for about 15 minutes relocated it farther down the dike. It was flycatching actively for about an hour before disappearing. My dad had just left when it flew out from a bush in front of me and made a beeline towards Connors farm about half a mile down the road. Naturally, this was right when Andrea Bean showed up. So, we drove down towards the farm as the light was quickly fading, and my dad rejoined us, only to make an incredible spot - picking up the bird across a field in a stand of deciduous trees. The bird finally flew off for good towards the Wenham rail trail.   It was a fun adventure and a stunning bird.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.00,3,,1949,2924

A challenge to count because the birds were moving slowly from tree to tree.  I first scanned the open field and hedge row of mesquites to the north of the parking area and trail.  Counted perched birds that I could see well.  Then walking the trail the WEKI would flush from trees toward the Aguirre drainage (with water) west of the lake (dry).  I waited to count birds in this drainage while walking the trail south along the dike because here the birds seemed to want to stay in the trees near water.

Après un arrêt d’urgence (!), nous nous doutons déjà, depuis l’intérieur de la voiture, à quelle espèce nous avons affaire! Une fois à l’extérieur, nous notons :  ·Oiseau de la taille d’un Tyran tritri, mais avec une allure plus élancée ·Port vertical, typique des tyrannidés ·Tête grise, un peu plus pâle sur la gorge, avec une mince ligne plus sombre traversant l’œil ·Dos gris-verdâtre ·Ailes brunes, chaque plume étant lisérée de blanc, les couvertures en particulier ·Queue brun sombre ·Le vexille externe des rectrices les plus externes est blanc, bien visible lorsque l’oiseau est en vol ·Poitrine grise et ventre (sous-caudales incluses) jaune très pâle ·Bec et pattes noirs ·Oeil sombre Les parties inférieures peu contrastées, le liséré pâle des couvertures alaires et la forme plutôt pointue des rectrices indiquent qu’il s’agit d’un juvénile. De plus, les commissures sont encore rosées, une caractéristique des oisillons au nid. Tous ces détails permettent de confirmer nos doutes et d’identifier l’oiseau : un Tyran de l’Ouest! Le tyran se nourrissait activement, attrapant des insectes en vol ou en allant les cueillir au sol avant de retourner se percher sur les fils. Il semblait en pleine forme malgré la température plutôt fraîche des dernière matinée. Il existe environ 45 mentions de l’espèce au Québec, la majorité en septembre et octobre. Il s’agit de la première mention pour la région de La Pocatière.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.00,3,,960,1290

One was on a telephone line and the other Kingbird was on a below eye level fence post, about 60 feet from the other Kingbird.   Both Kingbirds  today acted much more like the Western Kingbirds I was used to seeing regularly in Southern California from mid March to mid September each year than I have previously seen here before hiding far away out in the trees not acting very 'Kingbird like"".  This species likes a super high point in a tree, or on Powerlines, or on fences and loves to ""hawk"" insects.    They were still on James Road, as they have been recently in the trees at 17527 James Rd., but today they were past the intersection of Jessamine Rd and James Rd, and were actually less than 200 feet from the furthest from I-75 intersection of James Rd and Blanton Rd. Remember, that Blanton and James Rd  intersect each other in two places less than a mile apart from each other.   Note the relatively short bill, the pale gray head, and the upper breast along with the whitish lower throat where the whitish color extends back back to below the eye. The lore is blackish. The light gray on the upper chest blends gradually into a relatively yellow belly.   The tail is blackish and has broad white outer edges to the outermost feathers.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.50,2,,815,1055

Dark grey head, grey breast, yellow belly. In most lighting conditions the breast did not appear as dark as I would have expected, but the contrast of the white chin/moustache patch stood out very well nonetheless. Tail was black. Tail feathers were quite worn but photos show faint pale edging on the tip of at least two of them. Dorsal view revealed no sign of white in the outer tail feathers. However, pictures from below show the outermost tail feathers having at least some white edging whose extent seemed to vary with lighting conditions, but it was barely visible with binos. For WIKI I would have expected the entire outer vain of the outer tail feathers to be white and obvious in flight even in their worn condition. Back was dullish grey but tinged slightly more greenish (as in WIKI) than brownish I would say, but again changing with the light. ID pending review. I have many more photos to go through and will gladly provide anything that might be useful.  Using this very useful resource - https://www.birds.cornell.edu/crows/kingbirdsX.htm   wing shape (see last photo) seems in line with WIKI, having long Primaries 7-10, whereas Tropical and Couch's have shorter P10 and longer P6 and P5. Unfortunately this resource does not detail Cassin's specifically, but this general pattern seems to hold true for them as well judging by flight photos of confirmed Cassin's on Macaulay Library.  UPDATE: Concensus emerged for WIKI after expert input and an extensive review of photos.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.50,2,,769,1026

Conclusion did change to WEKI with the following analysis provided by Peter Pyle:   ""Fun bird, invoking thoughts of Couch's Kingbird (p10 &gt; p5 to rule out Tropical) but I just checked Macaulay and find no COKIs with white outer webs to the outer rectrices.  So it's a Western that is brighter than most we see in North America because it has molted it's body feathers, something they usually do in Mexico, and then by the time they come back up in spring they are worn and faded again.  What's of more interest to me (almost) than the species is that it's an HY that has suspended an eccentric preformative molt after replacing p4-p6. Something like the bird in Figure 2A here: https://www.birdpop.org/docs/pubs/Pyle_2021_Defining_Moults.pdf  Typically they go to the Mexican monsoon region to start this molt, suspend it for migration to southern Mexico/Central American winter grounds, and complete it there. Your bird may have gone down there at first to begin the molt abd then underwent a 180 degree migration for leg 2. Or maybe it just started the molt up here somewhere.""",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.50,2,,1486,2229

Andrew and I got good views of it between 7AM and 7:30AM. We felt it was a really late Western. One of the first things we noticed was its single-syllable 'chik' call note, we thought sounded Western-like. The belly was yellow, fading to gray in the breast. We got views of the white outer web of the outer tail feathers on an otherwise black tail. The folded tail looked 'notched' like a Tropical/Couch's, but that could have a feather-folding issue rather than the shape of the tail. The bill was small, not the Tropical/Couch's length. The dark mask was ill-defined and subdued. The back had a slight yellowish tint compared to the gray head, but really appeared to be a shade of gray.  Conclusion Given the late date, Tom Heindel told us a Tropical Kingbird would be more expected than a Western.  So, we studied up on Tropical Kingbird and we were ready for it the morning of the 3rd when we went to find it. Alas, we will have to wait for a ¿real¿ Tropical.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.50,2,,1536,2048

We originally thought this bird was possibly a TRKI, due to lack of white in the outer tail feathers, a notched look at the tail end, and it gave an appearance in the field of yellow up towards the throat, during a brief moment when it faced us. A 2nd WEKI was nearby and had bold white tail feathers, making this bird seem very different.  Notes from our eBird reviewer state: ""The white tip of the tail feather shown on your bird suggests a very very fresh feather... in short, the tail appears to be in molt, causing both the lack of white outers and the 'notched' look with short centrals. Tail molt is a big problem in kingbirds, which is why bill size/shape is a key feature.""",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,3.67,3,,762,1143

Will read up on Cassin’s Kingbird and send images to others - open to turning this bird into a lifer! I have no problem being wrong on this!  Cassin’s being the more rare species for FL. But reporting what was seen and confirmed in field for now. *some other images came up that MAY show hint of old white along the very tips of tail but I don’t know if there is enough evidence with this debate just yet to call this bird one way or another. As of 17:07 I’m changing this to a / until I can find better images or a more experienced birder can assist with the ID and point out something I’m overlooking.  *Thanks to a great discussion on What’s This Bird? Facebook group pointing out excellent field marks in my images, changing this back to the WEKI.   Summarizing: looking at the entire bird, this is what we see. 1. The coloration of the chest and throat are too light to be a Cassin’s Kingbird. In a Cassin’s Kingbird your would expect it to be a darker gray, or at least a gray that matches the top of the head so that the entire hood of the bird makes that white cheek patch really pop out. 2. The top of the tail does show a thin, white edge, and barely any white tip. I was incorrect here thinking that was only a Western trait. Looking online, there is a lot of overlap between the two species. Some images show how Cassin’s can have a thin white edge visible on the upper tail. Some in-flight photos of the bird taken by others, show a thin, barely visible, white tips on the tail feathers. That is a trait normally suggesting Cassin’s. But the white tip on this particular bird is not definitive enough to make it called based on that trait alone. Some images of western kingbird show wearing on the tail tip and appearing white as well! 3. Switching to the underside of the tail you can see, at least in a handful of images, nice distinctive, full white tail feathers along the edge. That is a trait for and pointed towards western kingbird. Finally, 4. White cheek patch extends beyond the eye on this individual, a trait that is another point for Western. With Cassin’s kingbird you would expect the white cheek patch to stop directly at the eye, or just short of it. Coloration varied based on lighting, and made it very tricky for some of the above characteristics to be seen clearly. At least in every image. Nobody saw enough coloration on the wing coverts that suggested a Cassin’s. That is another trait one could look for in the future. Taken all together, this bird has enough characteristics the point towards western kingbird as the correct ID.  Fun challenge.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.00,2,,3024,4032

My observations were of a western type kingbird with a bright yellow belly, grey throat and head with black through eye, wings and back were grayish, tail was obscured.  After reviewing Ernie’s photos, I believe this to be a Western Flycatcher but welcome all opinions.  Bill appears too short for Tropical, tail appears black and darker than wings, wing tips appear to project further down the tail.

Bird was silent as far as I can tell but I’m not familiar with its calls and may have missed them. It was flushed from a leafless tree by mockingbirds/robin. The bird then moved to a dogwood to feed on its berries. ID information: Lemonade colored belly. Black tail with white edges . Short bill . Black legs. Gray head. Black stripe on lores. Distinguished from tropical/couch's after viewing the tail in particular as is evident in my pictures. George very helpfully pointed out that coverts look scaley and suggest the bird is juvenile. First seen at dropped pin https://goo.gl/maps/Gj7wCCRZpAGnMuH6A . Use Google maps to find the location. Relocated later with many other birders fluttering around the railroad tracks. The bird eventually disappeared across the railroad tracks after being seen on a nearby telephone wire.

I had not seen the bill or tail particularly well, but the overall coloration and shape seemed right for Gray and I knew it wasn't an Eastern (the only expected Tyrannus here). I got word out via the Bristol County alert group as a possible Gray Kingbird. Thankfully, I did not have to wait too long and it reappeared and made a long flight overhead, over the parking lot, and then back to the thickets, which is where all the below images were taken except the hovering one. When I finally refound it it was clearly “just” a dull juvenile Western Kingbird, still a new species for the hotspot and an overdue vagrant here. Seen well on three other occasions, including several hovering flights with tail spread, showing black, squared-off tail with prominent white on outer rectrices. Gray upperparts with broad pale edging on coverts confirm age as hatch-year. Later it must have moved south down the island, since Bev King came and we did not relocate it until about 8:35 when it made a high flyover pass at Sumac Thicket (seen also by Bev and Marcus Hunt).

It had a dark tail and a band through the eye. It had a sharp pointy beak. Its size and colour made it unusual for our area – most yellow birds are smaller. The other option was a grosbeak, but the beak was incorrect. The other option was the Australian robin, but that was not likely! I flirted with the idea that is might be a flycatcher, but doubted that for the time of year.  It seemed to like sitting in the leafless poplar tree and was always alone. The tree may have given it protection from the east wind, but it was in the full force of the south wind which is the coldest. It would flit about to the edge of the house and then back to the tree. It did not attend the sunflower seed feeder. The bird was usually noticed from about 11 am to 3pm. One day it was noticed on the north side of the house, but only for that afternoon.  The current last sighting was with a group of Bohemian Waxwings and robins as they demolished the berries on the dogwood tree.

Après un arrêt d’urgence (!), nous nous doutons déjà, depuis l’intérieur de la voiture, à quelle espèce nous avons affaire! Une fois à l’extérieur, nous notons :  ·Oiseau de la taille d’un Tyran tritri, mais avec une allure plus élancée ·Port vertical, typique des tyrannidés ·Tête grise, un peu plus pâle sur la gorge, avec une mince ligne plus sombre traversant l’œil ·Dos gris-verdâtre ·Ailes brunes, chaque plume étant lisérée de blanc, les couvertures en particulier ·Queue brun sombre ·Le vexille externe des rectrices les plus externes est blanc, bien visible lorsque l’oiseau est en vol ·Poitrine grise et ventre (sous-caudales incluses) jaune très pâle ·Bec et pattes noirs ·Oeil sombre Les parties inférieures peu contrastées, le liséré pâle des couvertures alaires et la forme plutôt pointue des rectrices indiquent qu’il s’agit d’un juvénile. De plus, les commissures sont encore rosées, une caractéristique des oisillons au nid. Tous ces détails permettent de confirmer nos doutes et d’identifier l’oiseau : un Tyran de l’Ouest! Le tyran se nourrissait activement, attrapant des insectes en vol ou en allant les cueillir au sol avant de retourner se percher sur les fils. Il semblait en pleine forme malgré la température plutôt fraîche des dernière matinée. Il existe environ 45 mentions de l’espèce au Québec, la majorité en septembre et octobre.

Andrew and I got good views of it between 7AM and 7:30AM. We felt it was a really late Western. One of the first things we noticed was its single-syllable 'chik' call note, we thought sounded Western-like. The belly was yellow, fading to gray in the breast. We got views of the white outer web of the outer tail feathers on an otherwise black tail. The folded tail looked 'notched' like a Tropical/Couch's, but that could have a feather-folding issue rather than the shape of the tail. The bill was small, not the Tropical/Couch's length. The dark mask was ill-defined and subdued. The back had a slight yellowish tint compared to the gray head, but really appeared to be a shade of gray.  Conclusion Given the late date, Tom Heindel told us a Tropical Kingbird would be more expected than a Western.  So, we studied up on Tropical Kingbird and we were ready for it the morning of the 3rd when we went to find it. Alas, we will have to wait for a ¿real¿ Tropical.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.00,2,,590,648

Interesting non-calling Kingbird that we just assume to be Tropical at first glance. However, narrow white edged outer rects majorly confused the issue with Western as a possibility. Bill seems not to be as long and robust as TRKI. Tail is molting with central rects appearing black and remainder somewhat brownish. More study and review of photos and other features might lead to a different conclusion than our initial submission as ""yellow bellied kingbird sp."" Conclusion did change to WEKI with the following analysis provided by Peter Pyle:   ""Fun bird, invoking thoughts of Couch's Kingbird (p10 &gt; p5 to rule out Tropical) but I just checked Macaulay and find no COKIs with white outer webs to the outer rectrices.  So it's a Western that is brighter than most we see in North America because it has molted it's body feathers, something they usually do in Mexico, and then by the time they come back up in spring they are worn and faded again.  What's of more interest to me (almost) than the species is that it's an HY that has suspended an eccentric preformative molt after replacing p4-p6. Something like the bird in Figure 2A here: https://www.birdpop.org/docs/pubs/Pyle_2021_Defining_Moults.pdf  Typically they go to the Mexican monsoon region to start this molt, suspend it for migration to southern Mexico/Central American winter grounds, and complete it there. Your bird may have gone down there at first to begin the molt abd then underwent a 180 degree migration for leg 2. Or maybe it just started the molt up here somewhere.""",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17298,,4.00,2,,642,963
