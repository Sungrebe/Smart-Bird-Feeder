The hawk doesn’t try to pull on the rodent, if you look closely, the thieving hawk was holding one toe of the other hawk in its beak and pinching hard on it, probably on a nerve, to entice an automatic release reaction and open the foot.

As soon as it landed, another Red-shouldered arrived and tried to steal the rodent from it. But, the rodent fell onto the ground. The second hawk immediately dove down to retrieve it. It took it some time to locate it in the grass. It then flew away with the rodent to a palm tree. The first bird called desperately. Notice the most interesting fact in the interaction. The hawk doesn’t try to pull on the rodent, if you look closely, the thieving hawk was holding one toe of the other hawk in its beak and pinching hard on it, probably on a nerve, to entice an automatic release reaction and open the foot. It worked. Another scene observed during the walk : a crow attacked a red-shouldered hawk and the hawk escaped flying away very fast.",Buteo lineatus,reshaw,Species,8391,,4.25,4,,2543,3814

The streaked bib and barred belly on a compact buteo captured my attention. The bird rotated its body and allowed me to see the black and white checkering in the flight feathers and the thick-banded tail. (see first two attached images). The RSHA was perched comfortably when a Cooper's Hawk (COHA) flew into the same line of cottonwood trees. The RSHA chased away the COHA. I observed the white crescents in the outer wings of the RSHA as it flew to push away the COHA. Three birders that I had just separated from prior to this encounter were able to come to the location and see the bird. The pin for this checklist is the actual spot from which I spotted the RSHA.",Buteo lineatus,reshaw4,Group,8397,,5.00,2,,1365,2048

It then flew past me within arm's length, perching on top of my Forester (photos). It was not shy, typical of many juvenile hawks. After about 10 minutes, it flew close by me again back to the willow. It was probably getting too hot on the roof of my car.

It took it some time to locate it in the grass. It then flew away with the rodent to a palm tree. The first bird called desperately. Notice the most interesting fact in the interaction. The hawk doesn’t try to pull on the rodent, if you look closely, the thieving hawk was holding one toe of the other hawk in its beak and pinching hard on it, probably on a nerve, to entice an automatic release reaction and open the foot.

The three were interacting, and all spent time sitting at the nest.  However, the two adults were acting in concert, frequently perched side by side.  It was unclear to me what their relationship to the immature bird was.  Certainly, this immature bird could not be recently fledged from this nest?  I don't know the nesting calendar of raptors in SC, but this seems impossible in mid-February.  Besides which, I have walked past this spot for the past ten days without seeing any Red-shouldered Hawks.  Could this immature bird be from the brood of a year ago, and staying with the parents until the next nesting, which is about to occur?  Could this be a would-be interloper, unrelated?  If anyone has insight into this, I would be very interested!  dbemont@rochester.rr.com",Buteo lineatus,reshaw,Species,8391,,5.00,2,,2143,2235
