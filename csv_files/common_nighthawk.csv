This bird began flying along the dike and then over the water of Lake Josephine at or shortly before 5 p.m. Typical nighthawk shape with long and pointed wings showing bold white bars across the basal portion of the primaries. Overall cold gray and blackish; the underparts were barred with black; the upperwing showed a prominent and broad silvery-gray ulnar bar; the throat appeared grizzled white and gray/black and was not crisp and white (this and wing shape and tail feathers suggest an HY male); tail clearly showed white subterminal band at least on one side of rectrices. The wings appeared somewhat blunt for this species. The bird foraged over the lake, generally staying and only inches above the water. It occasionally rose steeply upward as if chasing something high over the lake. While gliding, it held wings above the body in a V with primaries angled or flexed slightly downward at the wrist. Quick and rapid turns.  Apparently juvenile male Common Nighthawks may molt their rectrices before completing migration. This bird exhibited an odd asymmetry, with the left outer rectrices apparently new and showing the white subterminal band of the male. The throat was typical of young bird, being grizzled. We also felt the wing tip was more blunt than expected on adults of this species. P10 is clearly shorter than P9 on this individual, this being a trait thought typical of Lesser Nighthawk. The cold coloration, shape of white wing bar (broadening to rear and squarish), and dark and virtually unbarred inner primaries all fit Common Nighthawk versus Lesser.",Chordeiles minor,comnig,Species,3439,,4.38,8,,2015,3022

This bird began flying along the dike and then over the water of Lake Josephine at or shortly before 5 p.m. Typical nighthawk shape with long and pointed wings showing bold white bars across the basal portion of the primaries. Overall cold gray and blackish; the underparts were barred with black; the upperwing showed a prominent and broad silvery-gray ulnar bar; the throat appeared grizzled white and gray/black and was not crisp and white (this and wing shape and tail feathers suggest an HY male); tail clearly showed white subterminal band at least on one side of rectrices. The wings appeared somewhat blunt for this species. The bird foraged over the lake, generally staying and only inches above the water. It occasionally rose steeply upward as if chasing something high over the lake. While gliding, it held wings above the body in a V with primaries angled or flexed slightly downward at the wrist. Quick and rapid turns.  Apparently juvenile male Common Nighthawks may molt their rectrices before completing migration. This bird exhibited an odd asymmetry, with the left outer rectrices apparently new and showing the white subterminal band of the male. The throat was typical of young bird, being grizzled. We also felt the wing tip was more blunt than expected on adults of this species. P10 is clearly shorter than P9 on this individual, this being a trait thought typical of Lesser Nighthawk. The cold coloration, shape of white wing bar (broadening to rear and squarish), and dark and virtually unbarred inner primaries all fit Common Nighthawk versus Lesser.",Chordeiles minor,comnig,Species,3439,,4.00,6,,1862,2793

Flushed from cottonwood grove. Mostly observed flying away or obscured behind trees, so no comment on the underwing in flight. Flight seemed obviously more direct than lesser, with less bounding style. Nabbed several photos of the bird perched on a high, conspicuous horizontal willow branch (an uncommon, though not impossible behavior for lesser). Primaries dark all the way down to the coverts, with no spotting apparent. White primary bar inconspicuous, but obviously lined up with the base (not the tip) of the tertials. Furthermore, p5 would be lined up directly behind the tertials in these photos, and the primary patches are clearly lined up well below p5, closer to where you would expect p4 or possibly even p3's tip. Also, white spot clearly on p6, which should never be the case for lesser nighthawk (only p7-p10). Appears to be a first year bird, which might explain the relatively short-winged look. Primaries appear relatively pointed. Overall tones are light gray, lacking obvious brown color.

I believe I was the 2nd person to lay eyes on it this evening. I was walking across the Riverdale Park grass from the parking lot toward the river, talking with D., when I saw a birder further ahead (an Asian gent, sorry I did not get your name) aim his camera at something above and behind us. I looked up and recognized the CONI immediately. It was silent, but I’d recently seen many in Texas. The bird had approached from the southwest and flew over Riverdale Park at 1710 (right on schedule) headed for its N. Lakeview Ave. bridge hunting ground. It must roost southwest of here. Out by the river, closer to the bridge, I stood with at least 18 other birders and enjoyed watching it fly up and down the river. A little west of the bridge it would turn back upstream, and then sometimes fly out of sight upstream, but always return to just west of the bridge and loop back around upstream. Always silent. Did not hear the distinctive “peent” call once. Captured it catching insects, and then missing (or changing its mind) on a dragonfly. Plenty insects at that altitude, apparently. A joy to watch, after the gamble I’d taken to drive up from far south and fight that traffic, on Day 6 even. Photos.",Chordeiles minor,comnig,Species,3439,,4.33,3,,,

Since the birds were flying rapidly to catch insects, the count was estimated by counting 5 birds and extrapolating to size of flock.

Bird photographer, Bob Grubbs, led me to the general area, but we couldn't find it.  Ken and Nancy Andersen were nearby and were kind enough to walk back and show us the bird.  Dave and Shannon Thompson came by and were able to see it as was Mercedes Leofsky from the Purple Martin Conservation Association. Also coming by was Pittsburgh birder Michelle Kienholz.  I was fortunate to be able to photograph it using a tripod from a distance of about 100 feet.  It was resting in the sun on an oak tree limb that hung out over the water at the south end of the Cement Sidewalk Trail.  It was camouflaged, but its white throat was visible as was its white wing bar.  The bird also gave about 6 loud and characteristic “peent” calls while sitting lengthwise on the branch.  Several of us watched it for over an hour.  It did a 180 degree turn on the branch while preening.  Most of the time it slept with its eyes closed.",Chordeiles minor,comnig,Species,3439,,5.00,2,,1912,2750

This bird began flying along the dike and then over the water of Lake Josephine at or shortly before 5 p.m. Typical nighthawk shape with long and pointed wings showing bold white bars across the basal portion of the primaries. Overall cold gray and blackish; the underparts were barred with black; the upperwing showed a prominent and broad silvery-gray ulnar bar; the throat appeared grizzled white and gray/black and was not crisp and white (this and wing shape and tail feathers suggest an HY male); tail clearly showed white subterminal band at least on one side of rectrices. The wings appeared somewhat blunt for this species. The bird foraged over the lake, generally staying and only inches above the water. It occasionally rose steeply upward as if chasing something high over the lake. While gliding, it held wings above the body in a V with primaries angled or flexed slightly downward at the wrist. Quick and rapid turns.  Apparently juvenile male Common Nighthawks may molt their rectrices before completing migration. This bird exhibited an odd asymmetry, with the left outer rectrices apparently new and showing the white subterminal band of the male. The throat was typical of young bird, being grizzled. We also felt the wing tip was more blunt than expected on adults of this species. P10 is clearly shorter than P9 on this individual, this being a trait thought typical of Lesser Nighthawk. The cold coloration, shape of white wing bar (broadening to rear and squarish), and dark and virtually unbarred inner primaries all fit Common Nighthawk versus Lesser.",Chordeiles minor,comnig,Species,3439,,3.60,5,,2015,3022

I only had a quick look at the bird, so pulled the car over as quickly as possible (narrow shoulder complicating things), hoping to get another glimpse of the nighthawk before it completely disappeared from sight. Though it had already gone beyond some trees, was pleasantly surprised to see the nighthawk, only about 20 seconds later, come flying right back over the road where it was first seen. Was even more surprised to see it fly into a live oak just above the road, and land on a large horizontal limb. Got good looks and photos (from a distance of maybe 25 yards). Appeared to be the much more expected (in this part of Texas) Common Nighthawk; the white wing patch could easily be seen on the folded wing of the bird, which crossed the primaries well short of the tertial tips, instead of directly below the tertial tips--or even slightly beyond--as in LENI.  Appeared to be a male based on the boldness [large size and brightness] of the white patch on the primaries, and also the boldness of the white throat patch.  Gray morph (as expected in this part of their range). No vocalizations were ever heard from the bird.  Although this would appear to be latish for a migrant, I have no idea if this general area might be potential breeding habitat for a CONI.

Vi tres nighthawks sobrevolando justo arriba y pensé en Lesser Nighthawk. De pronto al menos una de las aves comenzó a vocalizar con el mismo sonido que había escuchado repetidas veces y que no había podido ver. Le envié el sonido a biólogos Melvin Bonilla y Guillermo Funes. Melvin envió el audio a John van Dort y a Roselvy Juárez quienes confirmaron la especie. También Guillermo la confirmó.

These birds were counted over a 20 minute period in small groups of 5 - 15, most being relatively low over the dunes but also some moving over the pines at North of Highland Campground. Other closer individuals flew directly over the beach and we even had a few out over the open ocean. Almost all the movement was to the WNW with only a few singles heading ESE. I enjoyed the movement as I always do when watching nighthawks but hadn't given any real thought to the significance of the number relative to Cape Cod.

Bird photographer, Bob Grubbs, led me to the general area, but we couldn't find it.  Ken and Nancy Andersen were nearby and were kind enough to walk back and show us the bird.  Dave and Shannon Thompson came by and were able to see it as was Mercedes Leofsky from the Purple Martin Conservation Association. Also coming by was Pittsburgh birder Michelle Kienholz.  I was fortunate to be able to photograph it using a tripod from a distance of about 100 feet.  It was resting in the sun on an oak tree limb that hung out over the water at the south end of the Cement Sidewalk Trail.  It was camouflaged, but its white throat was visible as was its white wing bar.  The bird also gave about 6 loud and characteristic “peent” calls while sitting lengthwise on the branch.  Several of us watched it for over an hour.  It did a 180 degree turn on the branch while preening.  Most of the time it slept with its eyes closed.",Chordeiles minor,comnig,Species,3439,,4.50,2,,2186,2750

The first one showed up at about 8:20 pm and the second and third one actually were darting around by the flag bearer statue at probably only 20 feet off the ground from what I could tell from my position down on the outer sidewalk (grounds close at 8pm). I had never seen them fly that low at this sight (wish I was up top in the actual monument area to have seen that). I  thought they initially might have been Hoary Bats due to their size and that is the normal flight area for bats, here, but then I could see from some of my photographs that the wings clearly had the vertical white wing bar on the outer area of the wings.",Chordeiles minor,comnig,Species,3439,,4.50,2,,1970,3500

Anyways, I saw a flock of swirling birds that I initially thought were swallows, then I realized that they were pretty large. Purple Martins? It took my head a few seconds to recalibrate and realize that I was seeing a flock of low-flying Common Night Hawks! They were flying over the ponds and feeding on insect swarms in the late afternoon sun! I dropped Robin off (at Brownton) and grabbed the camera and headed back to spend the next 20 minutes or so shooting off ~2000 frames trying to capture these nightjars while they dodged photons coming from my camera. My arms were tired trying to track them while maintaining focus. It felt like someone was throwing a knuckleball not knowing which way it'll dip. But, I managed a few keepers, including some with their mouths wide open and ready to snatch flying insects. A nice way to come home. I took Asia out in the yard a while later and saw the flock return right over the house.

Its flight style was very hawk-like hovering around and not direct, turning and making some loops in the sky while gradually moving east. Interestingly, last time I spotted nighthawks in the same area they were also flying east, so maybe they go in that direction for the night? (not really sure what is over there but it definitely is interesting), however last time I saw them they flew by quite fast and quite low (ok not as fast as canada geese or ducks for example but the flight was relatively direct without turning around like a hawk like this one). initially while seen in the viewfinder it was so far away, I couldn't quite make it out what it was and thought it might be some kind of accipiter or even a merlin or kestrel ( like some kind of falcon because of thing wings + short head and long tail), but I was just guessing. It stayed in my vision for about 30 seconds before it went far west of neshaminy creek and disappeared from sight, only identified it after reviewing photos.
