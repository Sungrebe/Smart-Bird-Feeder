Wary and shy of my presence but tolerating with slow and precise movements.

I played back the song to see what it sounded like and immediately a fairly good sized bird flew over my head and into a nearby tree.  The sun was down behind the trees so it was hard to get a good picture, but as I was trying, my sister looked up the ID info for the cuckoo.  The bird we were watching had a long slightly curved black bill, a very long slender tail with white showing on the tips. the belly was a plain white and the back was dark.

Plus it seems a little late in the season for juvenile yellows to still have a black bill.  Pros for juvenile yellow: also the black bill, rufous patch on the wings, and black-billed is rare on the coast. Unfortunately didn't get a look at the undertail before it flew off.  We were clued into this bird by his call which was 3 notes and did not vary in pitch or cadence. Observed in line of trees across from spawar building before it flew onto a power line. After perching for a minute or so, it flew west and we could not relocate the bird. See pictures.",Coccyzus erythropthalmus,bkbcuc,Species,3193,,4.33,3,,613,729

No rufous visible on primaries from photo. A yellow billed cuckoo was in area ... but they did not interact like parent juvenile, and red eye ring  separates adult black billed from juvenile yellow billed.

All black bill, slightly grayish on lower mandible closest to base.  Virtually no rusty coloration on wings as seen in photos, or maybe none at all.  Face and cheek white, contrasting with cap which I think would makes this a juv. YBCU.  BBCU should be buffy/tan colored through throat and not sharply contrasting with gray on head?  YBCU juv. known to have all black bill.  Bill also maybe slightly chunkier than what BBCU would have?  Unsure of species, any comments welcome.  Knut had a 2nd heard only BBCU calling that I heard too little of to say that I ""heard it"".    9/5/17 updated to BBCU from the BBCU/YBCU that I had previously listed it as.  Email with ME reviewer, Louis Bevier in which he suggests the following:    ""That cuckoo appears to be a Black-billed Cuckoo. You seemed to have eliminated that species for a lack of buff on the throat, but that is only a pale wash on some. Also, the yellow on the mandible of juvenile Yellow-billed is more restricted but rarely (if ever?) totally absent. The bill color is perfect for Black-billed. The real clincher has to be the wings, which in your one profile shot show enough to determine that there is no rufous in the primaries. That is consistent with Black-billed and wrong for Yellow-billed.  I hope that helps you. I recommend putting this in as Black-billed.""  KS reviewer J. King also felt BBCU a better match and suggested the following:  ""In juvenile plumage (lasts from fledgling until a partial molt that occurs after a few months of life) YBCU should have some red in the flight feathers and coverts. Regarding BBCU, it says ""feathers of nape, scapulars, wing coverts, and rump tipped with dull grayish white"". It also says the tail of the BBCU is particularly short.""",Coccyzus erythropthalmus,bkbcuc,Species,3193,,5.00,2,,1132,1731

I'm sure he's come to know me well as I've searched for him unsuccessfully the last few days.  Slender, delicate and athletically built cuckoo, with darker brown tones to body, a hint of rufous to the wings, and a thin tail lacking conspicuous markings. Immature bird with pale yellow orbital ring. Slender all dark bill.  Caught a glimpse of movement as the bird came in high from the North, flushed by another entity which I did not observe.  Actually quite mobile, flying from tree to tree. Wary and shy of my presence but tolerating with slow and precise movements. At one point the bird flew from its high hickory into small dense trees about 15 feet off the ground and less distance than that away from me, providing a great experience! I lost track of it shortly after. Plenty of tent caterpillar nests around, but I did not witness him utilizing any. One of my favorite species!

Had now been accepted by Ebird reviewer as Black billed Cuckoo. Pros for juvenile black: the all-black bill, pale orbital ring, and pale edging on the feathers.  Plus it seems a little late in the season for juvenile yellows to still have a black bill.  Pros for juvenile yellow: also the black bill, rufous patch on the wings, and black-billed is rare on the coast. Unfortunately didn't get a look at the undertail before it flew off.  We were clued into this bird by his call which was 3 notes and did not vary in pitch or cadence. Observed in line of trees across from spawar building before it flew onto a power line. After perching for a minute or so, it flew west and we could not relocate the bird. See pictures.",Coccyzus erythropthalmus,bkbcuc,Species,3193,,3.67,3,,813,1219

Immature bird with pale yellow orbital ring. Slender all dark bill.  Caught a glimpse of movement as the bird came in high from the North, flushed by another entity which I did not observe.  Actually quite mobile, flying from tree to tree. Wary and shy of my presence but tolerating with slow and precise movements. At one point the bird flew from its high hickory into small dense trees about 15 feet off the ground and less distance than that away from me, providing a great experience! I lost track of it shortly after. Plenty of tent caterpillar nests around, but I did not witness him utilizing any. One of my favorite species!

Sorry for late addition but in all the excitement of trying to observe the bird this photo was taken at a different time than the others and was in with the yellow-billed cuckoo photos.)  Saw bird in good view perched but without camera.  Then refound buried in bush with camera.  Cuckoo with all black bill and red eye orbital.  Never saw underside of tail.  Bill was thinish.  No rufous visible on primaries from photo. A yellow billed cuckoo was in area ... but they did not interact like parent juvenile, and red eye ring  separates adult black billed from juvenile yellow billed.  Rufous was visible on primaries of yellow-billed Cuckoo, bill was thicker and had bright yellow, no red eye ring visible.

Then saw this juvenile cuckoo (with outer tail feathers not fully grown) in an open tree. Watched it with Rob Hansen (visiting from CA) and concluded it was a juvenile Yellow-billed despite having some black-billed ""characters"" including yellowish throat and breast, dark bill, barring on upperparts, and a slim bill at some angles. YBCU may have bred here this year and this may be one of the young, but a Black-billed was apparently reported here yesterday which seems unusual given the time of year. Appreciate any comments on ID. UPDATE: After looking at many pictures on Ebird, the photographed bird matched juvenile BBCU, especially by the pale tips to coverts that are prominent on many BBCU and hardly or not present on YBCU. The undertail also has no white spots - thanks for comments by Amy Kearns and Matthew Cvetas.",Coccyzus erythropthalmus,bkbcuc,Species,3193,,4.00,2,,3456,4608

It responded to a playback and although it was raining Brian was able to obtain some photographs of the Cuckoo.  The bird then flew north across the road into another clump of trees where both Brian and Chris were both able to obtain further photographs of this quite co-operative bird.

I'm sure he's come to know me well as I've searched for him unsuccessfully the last few days.  Slender, delicate and athletically built cuckoo, with darker brown tones to body, a hint of rufous to the wings, and a thin tail lacking conspicuous markings. Immature bird with pale yellow orbital ring. Slender all dark bill.  Caught a glimpse of movement as the bird came in high from the North, flushed by another entity which I did not observe.  Actually quite mobile, flying from tree to tree. Wary and shy of my presence but tolerating with slow and precise movements. At one point the bird flew from its high hickory into small dense trees about 15 feet off the ground and less distance than that away from me, providing a great experience! I lost track of it shortly after. Plenty of tent caterpillar nests around, but I did not witness him utilizing any. One of my favorite species!

I watched the first bird for several minutes, after which it took off and headed southeast.  I was quite surprised to see another BBCU fly out of the same tree right behind it; maybe it was better hidden, or perhaps I was so focused on the first one that I hadn't noticed.

When looking at my pictures, noting the dark bill, I focused in on the pale ""panels"" in between the black spots on the underside of the tail.  I ticked this as a juvenile Yellow-billed Cuckoo.  However, since the 27th I've been looking at my photos at length and, while admittedly they are not the sharpest, I've seen more than I did at first:  **  The large ""whitish panels"" on the underside of the tail aren't necessarily big white spots; the tail is backlit which I think makes these areas appear much lighter than they really are. **  The eyering is pale but has a slightly greenish cast. **  The bill is black but the base of the lower mandible, while also dark, is silvery. **  The throat and upper breast are clearly buffy and contrast with the white belly. **  Upperside feathers have pale fringes. **  There are contrastingly blackish spots at the bottom of the ""whitish panels.""  Each one has a narrow white terminal band.  In addition, I reached out to Ted Floyd at the ABA and asked for his expert opinion.  He was kind enough to reply:  ""I would go with Black-billed. It's got the mostly gray tail, the dark bill, and a buffy throat. Best, --TF""  So, I'm deleting Yellow-billed and adding Black-billed.",Coccyzus erythropthalmus,bkbcuc,Species,3193,,3.33,3,,3456,4608

Immature YB lacks yellow on bill through Aug. according to Sibley, so YB should show some yellow by now.  Very bad pic showing bit of tail appears to show small white ticks consistent with BB.  Bird was found very low and seemed to prefer low cedars along path.  Flushed into deciduous when walkers came by.  After several minutes, returned to low cedars along path.  Pete Dunne's Field Guide companion notes that BB forages lower than YB.  VA Gold Book extreme date for BB is 10/24, much later than I'd have guessed.  Based on all above info, entering as BB.",Coccyzus erythropthalmus,bkbcuc,Species,3193,,3.50,2,,612,667

When looking at my pictures, noting the dark bill, I focused in on the pale ""panels"" in between the black spots on the underside of the tail.  I ticked this as a juvenile Yellow-billed Cuckoo.  However, since the 27th I've been looking at my photos at length and, while admittedly they are not the sharpest, I've seen more than I did at first:  **  The large ""whitish panels"" on the underside of the tail aren't necessarily big white spots; the tail is backlit which I think makes these areas appear much lighter than they really are. **  The eyering is pale but has a slightly greenish cast. **  The bill is black but the base of the lower mandible, while also dark, is silvery. **  The throat and upper breast are clearly buffy and contrast with the white belly. **  Upperside feathers have pale fringes. **  There are contrastingly blackish spots at the bottom of the ""whitish panels.""  Each one has a narrow white terminal band.  In addition, I reached out to Ted Floyd at the ABA and asked for his expert opinion.  He was kind enough to reply:  ""I would go with Black-billed. It's got the mostly gray tail, the dark bill, and a buffy throat. Best, --TF""  So, I'm deleting Yellow-billed and adding Black-billed.",Coccyzus erythropthalmus,bkbcuc,Species,3193,,3.50,2,,3456,4608
