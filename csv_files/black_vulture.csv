Don Mairs and I arrived in the area and first tried looking on the river side of town along 3rd Street. We had gone no further than the first corner when we saw the bird sitting on a rooftop.  Stocky vulture with heavy neck ruff, black and wrinkled skin on head, dark gray legs and feet, all black body that was short at the rear. I could see white primary shafts on the outer primaries. The bill had a paler, hooked nail. The bird flew down to drink from ice melt at the edge of a driveway. I noted the white in the outer wings and short, squared tail. The bird sat on its tarsi to dip down and drink. The left eye appeared damaged, and the bird acted skittish to that side, sometimes wheeling around to its right (good eye side) to see what was ""around the other side."" Quite comical in motion. After drinking, the bird flew on its own up to a tall conifer, where it perched mid to lower-mid height.  It is possible this is the same Black Vulture seen by Fyn Kynd in Searsmont (27-28 May this year: https://ebird.org/ebird/me/view/checklist/S29947946). That bird held its left eye closed similar to what I saw on the Farmingdale bird. With the eyelid open, the Farmingdale bird showed the damage to the eye itself. But Fyn points out that his bird perhaps had the left eye missing entirely, showing a more sunken socket. Odd coincidence if so.",Coragyps atratus,blkvul,Species,7716,,4.00,7,,2615,3923

Based on reports I knew it roosts in the eucs just north of the school on Olema-Bolinas Rd. After missing this bird earlier in the day I decided to come back and stake-out the spot in the late afternoon, hoping I could see the bird as it came in. After an hour wait here, at least two dozen vultures started to stream in to their eucalyptus roost around 3:30pm. Near the group, but not always with them, the BLVU appeared from the south. For the next 20 minutes it flew around the area, and made multiple passes directly overhead. Last seen flying off to the north. Smaller than the TUVUs, with broader, flatter black wings, and silver primaries. Black head, very short, almost triangular tail. Due to wind it was soaring much of the time, but occasionally it would flap its wings with quicker, snappier wingbeats than the TUVUs, more like a hawk. Easy to pick out of the TUVUs by these features even with the naked eye. Many photos to be posted. Lifer!",Coragyps atratus,blkvul,Species,7716,,4.67,3,,898,1257

How’s that for a telephone line. I notified Jon Dunn who lives close by and met him at the ranch where the bird had been photographed earlier that morning at 7:40 AM. The bird was on private property but could be seen from the Pine Creek Road if you looked hard. The owner came out and invited us onto the property where we got close looks and photographed. We believe it to be the same bird that was here last year at the exact same time for the Bishop Christmas Bird Count. Last year‘s bird had an injured left eye as does this bird. There is a dead calf nearby in the field and the owner feels this is what attracted the Black Vulture to this area.  Amazing that this bird has returned to spend the winter or at least a portion of it here in Bishop once again. I cried. Entirely black vulture with shriveled grayish facial skin. Right eye looks normal and slightly reddish and left eye is closed shut with shriveled skin all around it. Very long pale gray hooked bill. Extensive white base on outer primaries.

They had moved on completely by about 1:20 and didn't return while I was there. Some small private planes started circling right around the cemetery so I'm not sure if that plays into it.  They moved on to the same place as last time- a residential area blocks away then into the air again.",Coragyps atratus,blkvul,Species,7716,,4.50,2,,2852,4249

One bird appeared to have a black head and an all black, not brown body, but it was situated lower on the roost, and partially blocked from view. I was nearly certain that it was a Black Vulture at that time, but was being cautious to avoid making a misidentification due to the failing light, or being lured into the trap of confirmation bias. Most of the other birds present were easily identified as Turkey Vultures, with their bare, red heads and dark brown bodies, but some were partially blocked from view at times. Since I couldn't identify the entire group with complete certainty, I decided to return to the roost early this morning, and try and have another look.   Taran arrived before I did this morning, and had already located and identified one of the Black Vultures. We both observed the entire group while it was still on the roost, and determined that there were six in total, and that most of them were Turkey Vultures. The birds eventually began lifting off and flying away, one by one. This was a great help to us, and they were all easily identified in flight. The two Black Vultures had bare, black heads, black bodies, and silvery wingtips clearly visible as they flew off.",Coragyps atratus,blkvul,Species,7716,,4.50,2,,2391,3783
