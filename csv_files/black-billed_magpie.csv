Today, I watched them taking turns bathing. There were 7 birds in the flock, with 1 an apparent sentinel. It stayed high up in a tree off to the east a ways; I conjecture that it was looking for danger--or rival magpie clans.  The 6 other birds took turns bathing. See especially the 5 videos, below.   Video 1. That was pretty typical. One bird would bathe for ~15 seconds, before either announcing its turn was over or being nudged out by another.  Video 2. This magpie completes its turn, hops out of the pool, then seems to say, ""Next?""  Video 3. A magpie is bathing, then another walks in and the first one moves on. Pretty peaceful, all things considered. (I conjecture that the magpie clans here--there are several--are family groups.)  Video 4. Sometimes 2 at a time (but I never saw more than 2) would bathe together. These two are besties, and their names are Snowball and Madonna.  Video 5. And then this would happen! Under the shade of Proto's, but just a couple meters away from the pool where they were bathing. Not sure I can interpret this behavior: Is this bird eating snow? Is it snow-bathing? Just goofing around? I'm not sure, but I saw this behavior from all the birds (except for the presumptive sentinel), I believe, at one time or another.",Pica hudsonia,bkbmag1,Species,21252,,4.33,3,,3332,4974

Today, I watched them taking turns bathing. There were 7 birds in the flock, with 1 an apparent sentinel. It stayed high up in a tree off to the east a ways; I conjecture that it was looking for danger--or rival magpie clans.  The 6 other birds took turns bathing. See especially the 5 videos, below.   Video 1. That was pretty typical. One bird would bathe for ~15 seconds, before either announcing its turn was over or being nudged out by another.  Video 2. This magpie completes its turn, hops out of the pool, then seems to say, ""Next?""  Video 3. A magpie is bathing, then another walks in and the first one moves on. Pretty peaceful, all things considered. (I conjecture that the magpie clans here--there are several--are family groups.)  Video 4. Sometimes 2 at a time (but I never saw more than 2) would bathe together. These two are besties, and their names are Snowball and Madonna.  Video 5. And then this would happen! Under the shade of Proto's, but just a couple meters away from the pool where they were bathing. Not sure I can interpret this behavior: Is this bird eating snow? Is it snow-bathing? Just goofing around? I'm not sure, but I saw this behavior from all the birds (except for the presumptive sentinel), I believe, at one time or another.",Pica hudsonia,bkbmag1,Species,21252,,5.00,2,,3378,5001

Lauren wanted to go swim & asked what she should do, I wanted to tell Tom Leskiw we had the bird. Lauren shooed the bird off her shoulder and went for a downstream swim.

Since then, apparently she had seen the birds on and off in the same area.  Today, my friend Laura spotted 2 birds while driving, it was sitting in a tree close to the road on the south side of Fingal Line at 39564 Fingal Line.  Then the 2 birds flew and we relocated at the north east side of 39638 Fingal Line along the tree line and the bean field, that is when we discovered 3  Magpies.  A couple other birders saw 4 Magpies.  Photos were taken.  2 of the 3 birds look to be lacking iridescent in the wings/tail, these are record photos.   1 adult and 2 juveniles seen.",Pica hudsonia,bkbmag1,Species,21252,,4.00,2,,1587,3150

It was the first bird we found as well pulled up to the wash at 7:07 A.M. just after pulling off of the 160 Highway.  The wash runs along both sides of the 160 north and south.  The bird flew from the wash and across the highway to the north side of the 160.  It was joined by another Magpie, and two more then came with the high possibility of another Magpie coming in also.  The fifth possible bird was obstructed but that is the impression of the bird that I highly got (fairly large, very long tail, etc.).  After observing this group of four, who continued to move north of the 160 along the Wash, we then headed down the known section of the wash, south of the 160 (this marked hotspot).  We started to immediately hear more Black-billed Magpies down the wash, and after covering a fairly short distance, we found four more of them close together in walking about a quarter mile.  During this time, the Magpies were highly vocal wherever they would go.  We carefully listened for any birds flying over head, especially those traveling southward.  Once the Magpies who went on the north side of the 160 and went in the north direction, we didn't observe them coming back south again in the short duration in which we observed the Magpies.  We felt that at least eight birds was an accurate count, with the possibility of more.    <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/107017772@N02/15221574648"" title=""008 by Tommy DeBardeleben, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2943/15221574648_b20fd66cb7_z.jpg"" alt=""008"" /></a>  <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/107017772@N02/15221656367"" title=""009 by Tommy DeBardeleben, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15221656367_bacf6c334b_z.jpg"" alt=""009"" /></a>",Pica hudsonia,bkbmag1,Species,21252,,4.00,2,,589,1000

It was the first bird we found as well pulled up to the wash at 7:07 A.M. just after pulling off of the 160 Highway.  The wash runs along both sides of the 160 north and south.  The bird flew from the wash and across the highway to the north side of the 160.  It was joined by another Magpie, and two more then came with the high possibility of another Magpie coming in also.  The fifth possible bird was obstructed but that is the impression of the bird that I highly got (fairly large, very long tail, etc.).  After observing this group of four, who continued to move north of the 160 along the Wash, we then headed down the known section of the wash, south of the 160 (this marked hotspot).  We started to immediately hear more Black-billed Magpies down the wash, and after covering a fairly short distance, we found four more of them close together in walking about a quarter mile.  During this time, the Magpies were highly vocal wherever they would go.  We carefully listened for any birds flying over head, especially those traveling southward.  Once the Magpies who went on the north side of the 160 and went in the north direction, we didn't observe them coming back south again in the short duration in which we observed the Magpies.  We felt that at least eight birds was an accurate count, with the possibility of more.    <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/107017772@N02/15221574648"" title=""008 by Tommy DeBardeleben, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2943/15221574648_b20fd66cb7_z.jpg"" alt=""008"" /></a>  <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/107017772@N02/15221656367"" title=""009 by Tommy DeBardeleben, on Flickr""><img src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15221656367_bacf6c334b_z.jpg"" alt=""009"" /></a>",Pica hudsonia,bkbmag1,Species,21252,,3.50,2,,783,1243
