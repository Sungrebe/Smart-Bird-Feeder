After extracting a seed, he would bang it a bit on a branch to loosen some outer covering and then consume the seed. I watched this bird do that at least 10 times. Once in a while, it would peck and drill into the bark, but I never saw it come up with anything.

Then watched it return to the second tree, was in the cover for less than a minute then it flew off giving several loud calls. I quietly observed the first bush then looked around the second tree - an older Juniper tree. Looking in the bark crevices and saw what initially seemed like a small grey mouse looking out. Then a JUTI flew out of a cavity and onto the branches of the tree. It gave several scolding calls. Backing off I took her photo, backed off further and took an audio of her vocalizations. Backed off further and waited about two minutes. She then flew back into the cavity. Waited about two more minutes but did not see either bird again. Best to head out. Thinking the first bird with the food was a male feeding a female on the nest.

Photos taken, confirming titmouse eating manzanita seeds.  Found the bird in a manzanita bush around 9:25 am.  The titmouse was exhibiting the same behavior as previously posted.  This time there were a few inches of snow on the ground and the bird mainly stayed up in the bush, picking the berries and then attacking them on a favorite branch in the manzanita.  It took just seconds for the bird to find a fruit before flying to the killing branch.  The bird would forage usually quiet for a minute or two before calling, and sometimes going to the top of the bush giving a few different calls as if claiming its territory.  I watched the bird, observing the repeated behavior for about an hour and 10 minutes in basically the same grouping of 2 or 3 manzanita bushes.",Baeolophus ridgwayi,juntit1,Species,21931,,4.00,2,,2555,3184

No hay otros registros para México en eBird, pero tengo una copia de Friedmann et al. (1958) Distributional Check-List of the Birds of Mexico que dice que hay registro en la Sierra San Luis de Sonora en el año 1954. Russell y Monson (1998) The Birds of Sonora, indica que hay tres registros para México. Aquí esta el texto de Russell y Monson, traducido de ingles: ""Estos pájaros fueron encontrados por primera vez en noviembre de 1951 por A. Phillips (Marshall 1957) en la ladera oeste de la Sierra de San Luis. Marshall colecto dos ejemplares en el mismo lugar el 2 de septiembre 1952. Russell observó una pareja forrajeando en robles de matorral en laderas orientadas al norte a 1620 m en el Arroyo Cajón Bonito, por encima de la comunidad ribereña ocupada por Baeolophus wollweberi, el 22 de mayo de 1982."" La ladera oeste de la Sierra de San Luis esta ubicado en ambos estados de Chihuahua y Sonora, así que no se en cual estado se observaron estos registros. [Mark Hoffman me mandó un correo indicando que hay otros dos registros de esa zona en la Sierra de San Luis. Uno está indicado en el libro de Steve Howell ""Birding-finding guide to Mexico"" en el sitio 2.5 Ague Prieta, en donde el los encontró en enero de 1996. El otro está recién entrado en eBird, por Alan Knue: https://ebird.org/checklist/S17250869 ]  En los dos semanas pasados se han encontrado muchos individuos de este especie en El Paso, donde hay pocos registros anteriormente, entonces no nos sorprendió mucho encontrar algunos en el Chamizal.   Contamos con cuidado la docena que estamos reportando. Habían cuatro en el centro del parque (junto al museo), cuatro en los pinos junto a la laguna, dos por el monumento a Benito Juarez, una al lado oeste del parque, y uno en los pinos al mero noroeste.   Todos se veían parecidos; aves pequeñas, de tamaño similar a un gorrión. Completamente gris, pero un poco más pálido en el pecho y por la cara. Todos tenían una cresta corta y erecta.   Sacamos muchas fotos y grabaciones de canto.",Baeolophus ridgwayi,juntit1,Species,21931,,3.33,3,,1793,2690

Photos taken, confirming titmouse eating manzanita seeds.  Found the bird in a manzanita bush around 9:25 am.  The titmouse was exhibiting the same behavior as previously posted.  This time there were a few inches of snow on the ground and the bird mainly stayed up in the bush, picking the berries and then attacking them on a favorite branch in the manzanita.  It took just seconds for the bird to find a fruit before flying to the killing branch.  The bird would forage usually quiet for a minute or two before calling, and sometimes going to the top of the bush giving a few different calls as if claiming its territory.  I watched the bird, observing the repeated behavior for about an hour and 10 minutes in basically the same grouping of 2 or 3 manzanita bushes.",Baeolophus ridgwayi,juntit1,Species,21931,,5.00,1,,2508,2855

Photos taken, confirming titmouse eating manzanita seeds.  Found the bird in a manzanita bush around 9:25 am.  The titmouse was exhibiting the same behavior as previously posted.  This time there were a few inches of snow on the ground and the bird mainly stayed up in the bush, picking the berries and then attacking them on a favorite branch in the manzanita.  It took just seconds for the bird to find a fruit before flying to the killing branch.  The bird would forage usually quiet for a minute or two before calling, and sometimes going to the top of the bush giving a few different calls as if claiming its territory.  I watched the bird, observing the repeated behavior for about an hour and 10 minutes in basically the same grouping of 2 or 3 manzanita bushes.",Baeolophus ridgwayi,juntit1,Species,21931,,3.50,2,,2367,3842

Then watched it return to the second tree, was in the cover for less than a minute then it flew off giving several loud calls. I quietly observed the first bush then looked around the second tree - an older Juniper tree. Looking in the bark crevices and saw what initially seemed like a small grey mouse looking out. Then a JUTI flew out of a cavity and onto the branches of the tree. It gave several scolding calls. Backing off I took her photo, backed off further and took an audio of her vocalizations. Backed off further and waited about two minutes. She then flew back into the cavity. Waited about two more minutes but did not see either bird again. Best to head out. Thinking the first bird with the food was a male feeding a female on the nest. But would have to do more research on that speculation.",Baeolophus ridgwayi,juntit1,Species,21931,,3.50,2,"",2992,2558

I’ve always thought Junipers look “less crisp” than Oaks & these birds fit that description. Birds were both calling quite a bit & the calls sounded good for Juniper. At least two birds, I saw them together multiple times. First seen around 12:40 & last seen about an hour later. The birds were where the trail in from San Francisco & Lily Ave. hits the lake, very close to the old pier. Behaving like Junipers as well, staying low most of the time, flitting between the ground & low branches of willows generally. Calls sounded a bit faster than Oak. The Oaks I’m used to at home also tend to have a broader repertoire of calls. These birds were pretty constant with their standard scold/contact calls. Birds also responded to Juniper playback. All the above said, I get that these birds are hard to split. I attempted to get a recording, but my phone wasn’t up to the task.

No hay otros registros para México en eBird, pero tengo una copia de Friedmann et al. (1958) Distributional Check-List of the Birds of Mexico que dice que hay registro en la Sierra San Luis de Sonora en el año 1954. Russell y Monson (1998) The Birds of Sonora, indica que hay tres registros para México. Aquí esta el texto de Russell y Monson, traducido de ingles: ""Estos pájaros fueron encontrados por primera vez en noviembre de 1951 por A. Phillips (Marshall 1957) en la ladera oeste de la Sierra de San Luis. Marshall colecto dos ejemplares en el mismo lugar el 2 de septiembre 1952. Russell observó una pareja forrajeando en robles de matorral en laderas orientadas al norte a 1620 m en el Arroyo Cajón Bonito, por encima de la comunidad ribereña ocupada por Baeolophus wollweberi, el 22 de mayo de 1982."" La ladera oeste de la Sierra de San Luis esta ubicado en ambos estados de Chihuahua y Sonora, así que no se en cual estado se observaron estos registros. [Mark Hoffman me mandó un correo indicando que hay otros dos registros de esa zona en la Sierra de San Luis. Uno está indicado en el libro de Steve Howell ""Birding-finding guide to Mexico"" en el sitio 2.5 Ague Prieta, en donde el los encontró en enero de 1996. El otro está recién entrado en eBird, por Alan Knue: https://ebird.org/checklist/S17250869 ]  En los dos semanas pasados se han encontrado muchos individuos de este especie en El Paso, donde hay pocos registros anteriormente, entonces no nos sorprendió mucho encontrar algunos en el Chamizal.   Contamos con cuidado la docena que estamos reportando.

No hay otros registros para México en eBird, pero tengo una copia de Friedmann et al. (1958) Distributional Check-List of the Birds of Mexico que dice que hay registro en la Sierra San Luis de Sonora en el año 1954. Russell y Monson (1998) The Birds of Sonora, indica que hay tres registros para México. Aquí esta el texto de Russell y Monson, traducido de ingles: ""Estos pájaros fueron encontrados por primera vez en noviembre de 1951 por A. Phillips (Marshall 1957) en la ladera oeste de la Sierra de San Luis. Marshall colecto dos ejemplares en el mismo lugar el 2 de septiembre 1952. Russell observó una pareja forrajeando en robles de matorral en laderas orientadas al norte a 1620 m en el Arroyo Cajón Bonito, por encima de la comunidad ribereña ocupada por Baeolophus wollweberi, el 22 de mayo de 1982."" La ladera oeste de la Sierra de San Luis esta ubicado en ambos estados de Chihuahua y Sonora, así que no se en cual estado se observaron estos registros. [Mark Hoffman me mandó un correo indicando que hay otros dos registros de esa zona en la Sierra de San Luis. Uno está indicado en el libro de Steve Howell ""Birding-finding guide to Mexico"" en el sitio 2.5 Ague Prieta, en donde el los encontró en enero de 1996. El otro está recién entrado en eBird, por Alan Knue: https://ebird.org/checklist/S17250869 ]  En los dos semanas pasados se han encontrado muchos individuos de este especie en El Paso, donde hay pocos registros anteriormente, entonces no nos sorprendió mucho encontrar algunos en el Chamizal.   Contamos con cuidado la docena que estamos reportando. Habían cuatro en el centro del parque (junto al museo), cuatro en los pinos junto a la laguna, dos por el monumento a Benito Juarez, una al lado oeste del parque, y uno en los pinos al mero noroeste.   Todos se veían parecidos; aves pequeñas, de tamaño similar a un gorrión. Completamente gris, pero un poco más pálido en el pecho y por la cara. Todos tenían una cresta corta y erecta.   Sacamos muchas fotos y grabaciones de canto.",Baeolophus ridgwayi,juntit1,Species,21931,,2.67,3,,1112,1668

Photos taken, confirming titmouse eating manzanita seeds.  Found the bird in a manzanita bush around 9:25 am.  The titmouse was exhibiting the same behavior as previously posted.  This time there were a few inches of snow on the ground and the bird mainly stayed up in the bush, picking the berries and then attacking them on a favorite branch in the manzanita.  It took just seconds for the bird to find a fruit before flying to the killing branch.  The bird would forage usually quiet for a minute or two before calling, and sometimes going to the top of the bush giving a few different calls as if claiming its territory.  I watched the bird, observing the repeated behavior for about an hour and 10 minutes in basically the same grouping of 2 or 3 manzanita bushes.",Baeolophus ridgwayi,juntit1,Species,21931,,3.00,1,,2907,2726

Added up to be the world high count. We closely tallied 23 individuals across the entirety of the south end of the golf course and the deep water pond (where we started) hit most of the NM Tech campus, and covered most of the north golf course including the popular wigeon pond. The count of 23 was taken with caution not to recount individuals. After reaching 23, we came across a huge stand of dead junipers (34.0707440, -106.9113268) where at least 16 individuals were observed at once. There were likely 20+ (maybe 25?) tucked in this extensive juniper stand however to be cautious, and possibly account for some unlikely error we’re conservatively sticking with 16. At this point we were at 39 and counted 3 more birds on the very northeast corner of the golf course away from the juniper stand. The final 2 individuals were east of the wigeon pond on the tech campus significantly away from any other places we observed JUTI in that area. I think it’s highly unlikely we counted anything twice, and believe the high accuracy on our initial count of 23 and the presumed undercount with the 16 should balance out any possibility of recounting a few birds.  Almost every Titmouse popped out of either one of the seemingly various Juniper species planted around the area or a pine. Many were calling however basically every bird was seen, many with the aid of mob tapes. Because we missed a couple small pine/juniper stands that likely held birds, and likely undercounted the group of 16 I think there are more than likely 50+ birds between the golf course and campus. I may have some crappy video of some individuals together and snapped a few pics of random single birds however as is often the case with documenting high counts, essentially all of our documentation comes from the details provided here.",Baeolophus ridgwayi,juntit1,Species,21931,,3.00,1,,1768,2653

I’ve always thought Junipers look “less crisp” than Oaks & these birds fit that description. Birds were both calling quite a bit & the calls sounded good for Juniper. At least two birds, I saw them together multiple times. First seen around 12:40 & last seen about an hour later. The birds were where the trail in from San Francisco & Lily Ave. hits the lake, very close to the old pier. Behaving like Junipers as well, staying low most of the time, flitting between the ground & low branches of willows generally. Calls sounded a bit faster than Oak. The Oaks I’m used to at home also tend to have a broader repertoire of calls. These birds were pretty constant with their standard scold/contact calls. Birds also responded to Juniper playback. All the above said, I get that these birds are hard to split. I attempted to get a recording, but my phone wasn’t up to the task.

I’ve always thought Junipers look “less crisp” than Oaks & these birds fit that description. Birds were both calling quite a bit & the calls sounded good for Juniper. At least two birds, I saw them together multiple times. First seen around 12:40 & last seen about an hour later. The birds were where the trail in from San Francisco & Lily Ave. hits the lake, very close to the old pier. Behaving like Junipers as well, staying low most of the time, flitting between the ground & low branches of willows generally. Calls sounded a bit faster than Oak. The Oaks I’m used to at home also tend to have a broader repertoire of calls. These birds were pretty constant with their standard scold/contact calls. Birds also responded to Juniper playback. All the above said, I get that these birds are hard to split. I attempted to get a recording, but my phone wasn’t up to the task.

I heard their calls coming from somewhere on the Bonnie Springs property, but eventually saw them flying and perching on trees closer to where I was off to the north. They look just like Oak Titmice, maybe with a slightly longer crest. The calls were pretty similar to Oak Titmouse, but much faster. I think they could get out a full ""ts-ts-ts-ch"" in well under half a second. It also sounded like they were higher-pitched.  (backstory added 8/13/21) It wasn't very long after finding the scrub-jays that I started to realize I was closer to the actual Bonnie Springs property than I felt really comfortable with, but it also seemed like as soon as I had figured this out, I could hear what I instantly recognized as this lifer parid coming from somewhere I was almost sure would be part of their private property. I already felt like I was pushing it being in an area where I could start to make out little snippets of their roads, so I didn't try to get closer. I might be crazy, but I don't like intentionally trespassing. Luckily for me, the titmice came my way! One was even so kind as to perch atop a mostly bare tree not far from me, albeit briefly. This is another hotspot first record (not hard to do with only 23 prior checklists, but there it is).",Baeolophus ridgwayi,juntit1,Species,21931,,2.00,1,,2095,2795

Behavior observed and call heard repeatedly. Video taken. I first heard tapping on a branch sounding like a woodpecker working. Before I encountered the ""woodpecker"" a Juniper Titmouse call was head in the same area as the tapping.  I found the Juniper Titmouse in a manzanita bush tapping on a branch with great force. It finished with what it was working on then dropped to the ground under the manzanita, picking up another object to work on. It did this repeatedly, ""up, destroy, down, pickup, repeat"". It travelled through several manzanitas repeating the behavior.  I could not tell what it was actually picking up off the ground, but after observation of the video, it seems to be the small manzanita seeds inside its fruit. Though, not confirmed by the video, I believe the bird was crushing the fruit on the ground, taking a small seed to the branch to work on, then dropping down to get more of the seeds from the crushed fruit. A screen shot of the paused video looks to be a manzanita seed.",Baeolophus ridgwayi,juntit1,Species,21931,,1.00,1,,406,600
