This area, the first half of shady trail, has been cleared as a fire barrier, and most of the underbrush and quite a few of the trees have been taken out. This created a very similar habitat to other places I've seen HAWO in the foothills. I would guess this bird is presumably here to stay, at least for a while, as it was frequently drumming and and creating tree cavities in at least two locations.

I then saw the black and white patterning, and realized it was a Hairy! In addition to sapsucker-like size, the bird also lacks the black barring on white outer tail feathers, which is diagnostic for Hairy. No red on nape, making it a female bird. The woodpecker was calling loudly, as it bounced between tree trunks. It hung around for about 5-6 mins, but sadly left before most of the other birders could see it.

I first heard the bird calling overhead as it landed on a Royal Palm along Celebration Lane. I initially thought it was a Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, given large size of bird. I then saw the black and white patterning, and realized it was a Hairy! In addition to sapsucker-like size, the bird also lacks the black barring on white outer tail feathers, which is diagnostic for Hairy. No red on nape, making it a female bird. The woodpecker was calling loudly, as it bounced between tree trunks. It hung around for about 5-6 mins, but sadly left before most of the other birders could see it.

It was very confiding, but extremely flighty - moving from tree to tree, tapping on them (appearing to be listening), and then moving to the next tree. After about 3-5 minutes of easy naked eye looks, it flew to a tree where evidently it had already been excavating, as there was a keyhole cavity that was quite fresh.  It reached into the keyhole and started eating ants and possibly a spider/beetle. Soon it started to tap just below the keyhole, and then started peeling the bark off , exposing the fresh wood below. After some more tapping to test out the wood's strength, it starting hammering in earnest, creating a second keyhole cavity connected to the first (all while I was filming). This larger combined keyhole apparently attracted more ants, and it seemed to hit the mother load. It was very patient in waiting for more ants to come. After probably 10-15 minutes of excavating and feasting, and when the ants seemed to dry up, it hitched up to a higher branch, and rubbed it's bill side to side on the branch.",Dryobates villosus,haiwoo2,Group,11315,,4.60,5,,3456,4608

Nice little family of HAWO’s we identified by call first - a loud, sharp, “pick” single note call then rapid trill afterwards. Obvious larger bill than DOWO. This same presumed family was seen a few days earlier in the nearby Acerage neighborhood. Birds seen in pines along dirt road that heads to south JWC entrance.

The best views I've ever had of a HAWO.  Unbelievably cooperative male on shady trail in the general vicinity of (38.652581,-121.211314) and only a few hundred feet from the parking lot. This area, the first half of shady trail, has been cleared as a fire barrier, and most of the underbrush and quite a few of the trees have been taken out. This created a very similar habitat to other places I've seen HAWO in the foothills. I would guess this bird is presumably here to stay, at least for a while, as it was frequently drumming and and creating tree cavities in at least two locations. It was still present in the same general area four hours later.",Dryobates villosus,haiwoo,Species,11314,,5.00,3,,1739,2395

Notice the white outer tail feathers lack the black baring of the similar but smaller Downy Woodpecker. These two woodpeckers are not each other's closest relatives. Both species exhibit parallel geographic variation with those in Eastern North America having more white spotting on their wings while those in the far West have little or no wing spotting. Thus the two seem to mimic each other across their range. This is sometimes called interspecific social dominance mimicry (Prum, Zool J Linn Soc, 172: 910-941, 2014). However it seems unlikely that this mimicry is driven by ""social dominance,"" but more likely by predator avoidance.

It was very confiding, but extremely flighty - moving from tree to tree, tapping on them (appearing to be listening), and then moving to the next tree. After about 3-5 minutes of easy naked eye looks, it flew to a tree where evidently it had already been excavating, as there was a keyhole cavity that was quite fresh.  It reached into the keyhole and started eating ants and possibly a spider/beetle. Soon it started to tap just below the keyhole, and then started peeling the bark off , exposing the fresh wood below. After some more tapping to test out the wood's strength, it starting hammering in earnest, creating a second keyhole cavity connected to the first (all while I was filming). This larger combined keyhole apparently attracted more ants, and it seemed to hit the mother load. It was very patient in waiting for more ants to come. After probably 10-15 minutes of excavating and feasting, and when the ants seemed to dry up, it hitched up to a higher branch, and rubbed it's bill side to side on the branch.",Dryobates villosus,haiwoo2,Group,11315,,5.00,2,,3300,4400
