The fledglings were for the most part perched in the open in bushes, and over the course of my watch the (lone) adult probably delivered between 30 and 40 food deliveries (I wish I had counted but didn't expect them to remain visible for so long). The fledglings could fly short distances around the bushes, but not yet at the age where they even thought about feeding themselves.  All but one food delivery fell into two categories: dragonflies and fruit/berries (also once a small insect sp.). Every dragonfly I was able to see before it was down the gullet was a Blue Dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis), both males and females. The adult brought 6 berry deliveries that I saw, one of which was dropped by the fledgling. Probably about 1 berry for every 8-10 dragonflies.  On one occasion I watched as the parent caught a blue dasher and perched on a nest box, and since it didn't eat it right away, I got ready for the photo op (hoping to get it feeding the fledglings), but then it flew out and caught a second blue dasher while still holding the first, and brought both to feed two fledglings, one after the other (caught that on video too)!  I also saw the adult catch and eat dragonflies for itself in the middle of its foraging runs.   The three fledglings were identifiable, as one (appears the youngest) has a crossed bill at the tips. Another bird has a damaged tail feather that sticks out, and these two birds spent a while huddled together.   The parent would stop and preen fairly often, and the fledglings would take the opportunity to get some shut-eye, especially with dusk approaching.  The fledglings were exploring their surroundings a bit, pecking at twigs and lichen, and also each other! I saw Crossbill pecking at another's tail feathers, and Tailfeather later returned the favor by pecking Crossbill in the face, dangerously close to its eyes, and also grabbing its nape.

The fledglings were for the most part perched in the open in bushes, and over the course of my watch the (lone) adult probably delivered between 30 and 40 food deliveries (I wish I had counted but didn't expect them to remain visible for so long). The fledglings could fly short distances around the bushes, but not yet at the age where they even thought about feeding themselves.  All but one food delivery fell into two categories: dragonflies and fruit/berries (also once a small insect sp.). Every dragonfly I was able to see before it was down the gullet was a Blue Dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis), both males and females. The adult brought 6 berry deliveries that I saw, one of which was dropped by the fledgling. Probably about 1 berry for every 8-10 dragonflies.  On one occasion I watched as the parent caught a blue dasher and perched on a nest box, and since it didn't eat it right away, I got ready for the photo op (hoping to get it feeding the fledglings), but then it flew out and caught a second blue dasher while still holding the first, and brought both to feed two fledglings, one after the other (caught that on video too)!  I also saw the adult catch and eat dragonflies for itself in the middle of its foraging runs.   The three fledglings were identifiable, as one (appears the youngest) has a crossed bill at the tips. Another bird has a damaged tail feather that sticks out, and these two birds spent a while huddled together.   The parent would stop and preen fairly often, and the fledglings would take the opportunity to get some shut-eye, especially with dusk approaching.  The fledglings were exploring their surroundings a bit, pecking at twigs and lichen, and also each other! I saw Crossbill pecking at another's tail feathers, and Tailfeather later returned the favor by pecking Crossbill in the face, dangerously close to its eyes, and also grabbing its nape.

The fledglings were for the most part perched in the open in bushes, and over the course of my watch the (lone) adult probably delivered between 30 and 40 food deliveries (I wish I had counted but didn't expect them to remain visible for so long). The fledglings could fly short distances around the bushes, but not yet at the age where they even thought about feeding themselves.  All but one food delivery fell into two categories: dragonflies and fruit/berries (also once a small insect sp.). Every dragonfly I was able to see before it was down the gullet was a Blue Dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis), both males and females. The adult brought 6 berry deliveries that I saw, one of which was dropped by the fledgling. Probably about 1 berry for every 8-10 dragonflies.  On one occasion I watched as the parent caught a blue dasher and perched on a nest box, and since it didn't eat it right away, I got ready for the photo op (hoping to get it feeding the fledglings), but then it flew out and caught a second blue dasher while still holding the first, and brought both to feed two fledglings, one after the other (caught that on video too)!  I also saw the adult catch and eat dragonflies for itself in the middle of its foraging runs.   The three fledglings were identifiable, as one (appears the youngest) has a crossed bill at the tips. Another bird has a damaged tail feather that sticks out, and these two birds spent a while huddled together.   The parent would stop and preen fairly often, and the fledglings would take the opportunity to get some shut-eye, especially with dusk approaching.  The fledglings were exploring their surroundings a bit, pecking at twigs and lichen, and also each other! I saw Crossbill pecking at another's tail feathers, and Tailfeather later returned the favor by pecking Crossbill in the face, dangerously close to its eyes, and also grabbing its nape.

Highly contrasting kingbird with mostly black back. dark gray wings with pale edged primaries and coverts, black head (extending below the eyes and forming a rounded ""cheek""), black bill sized maybe a bit bigger than Cassin's, white throat, white breast with gray splotches, white belly, flanks, and vent, underwing coverts and axillaries on the paler side, white tail tips with one fresh rectrix (R2?) growing out and featuring a brighter white tip than the other rectrices. Pale undertail edges (but not thick white as in WEKI). Additional signs of molt on top of head. Lower mandible a bit pale at base and barely visible pale gape. Non-vocal. Photos to come.

Seen approximately from here (33.094036, -117.284289); NE of the intersection of Kingfisher Ln and Batiquitos Dr. Perched in the Carrotwood tree for majority of my observation, periodically preening and observing its surroundings. Seemed to be unfazed by the numerous CAKIs, HOORs, and smaller passerines who were foraging in the same tree. Later seen foraging and periodically sallying and moving around in the Carrotwood.   Seen with Curtis Marantz, who I kidnapped on the way, and who generously shared his scope and lowered it down to ""Sylvia-height"" (lol).

Highly contrasting kingbird with mostly black back. dark gray wings with pale edged primaries and coverts, black head (extending below the eyes and forming a rounded ""cheek""), black bill sized maybe a bit bigger than Cassin's, white throat, white breast with gray splotches, white belly, flanks, and vent, underwing coverts and axillaries on the paler side, white tail tips with one fresh rectrix (R2?) growing out and featuring a brighter white tip than the other rectrices. Pale undertail edges (but not thick white as in WEKI). Additional signs of molt on top of head. Lower mandible a bit pale at base and barely visible pale gape. Non-vocal. Photos to come.

The fledglings were for the most part perched in the open in bushes, and over the course of my watch the (lone) adult probably delivered between 30 and 40 food deliveries (I wish I had counted but didn't expect them to remain visible for so long). The fledglings could fly short distances around the bushes, but not yet at the age where they even thought about feeding themselves.  All but one food delivery fell into two categories: dragonflies and fruit/berries (also once a small insect sp.). Every dragonfly I was able to see before it was down the gullet was a Blue Dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis), both males and females. The adult brought 6 berry deliveries that I saw, one of which was dropped by the fledgling. Probably about 1 berry for every 8-10 dragonflies.  On one occasion I watched as the parent caught a blue dasher and perched on a nest box, and since it didn't eat it right away, I got ready for the photo op (hoping to get it feeding the fledglings), but then it flew out and caught a second blue dasher while still holding the first, and brought both to feed two fledglings, one after the other (caught that on video too)!  I also saw the adult catch and eat dragonflies for itself in the middle of its foraging runs.   The three fledglings were identifiable, as one (appears the youngest) has a crossed bill at the tips. Another bird has a damaged tail feather that sticks out, and these two birds spent a while huddled together.   The parent would stop and preen fairly often, and the fledglings would take the opportunity to get some shut-eye, especially with dusk approaching.  The fledglings were exploring their surroundings a bit, pecking at twigs and lichen, and also each other! I saw Crossbill pecking at another's tail feathers, and Tailfeather later returned the favor by pecking Crossbill in the face, dangerously close to its eyes, and also grabbing its nape.

This is my fourth viewing of this bird and the closest I’ve been to it, maybe twenty feet at times. The bird seemed more comfortable around other kingbirds, but was still wary of humans. Was able to follow it westward down fence line. Bird was mostly in and around paved loop, at times perching on fence, in trees, and on large flowering stalks. Seen flycatching and perching next to Western Kingbird and female Red-winged Blackbirds. I finally had better looks and hadn’t noticed the dark wash on chest until today though I’d seen it mentioned on another birder’s post, otherwise white underside and chin, and mostly coal and some brown on upperparts (wings, back head, nape).

Marantz on 11 June 2023 at the Pelican Point entrance to Crystal Cove State Park, Orange County, California.","Although this bird had been moving back-and-forth along the bluffs before I arrived, it flew to the northeast just as I walked up and landed in a small tree near the entrance kiosk.  We then spent a few minutes studying this bird and taking photographs before it flew off to the north across the Pacific Coast Highway and landed in one of the large eucalyptus trees on the north side of the road.  I saw the kingbird only briefly as it perched in the upper branches of this tree before it flew when I looked away.  Despite my expending much effort in search of the kingbird, I never did see this bird again.  As such, I managed to get good, yet relatively brief, views of this bird from behind when it perched atop the tree near the entrance kiosk, followed by rather distant views when it was in the tree across the road.  Much like other Eastern Kingbirds that I have seen in California, this bird was silent. this was a relatively large, heavy-bodied flycatcher that when seen fighting with a presumed Cassin's Kingbird appeared roughly similar in size and structure, though it may have had a shorter tail.  I noted that the bill was relatively short and tapering from a base of medium depth to what appeared to be a blunt tip along a culmen that was slightly decurved, but i did not compare the length relative to field-marks on the face.  The forehead was sloping and the crown seemed to be comparably sloped upward to what appeared to be a subtle peak above and behind the eye, all on a head that was a bit large for the bird's size.  the neck was short and stout, and the body was plump, full-chested, and with a roughly diagonal posture and the tail held downward in the plane of the body.  I failed to notice in the field both the primary projection and the length and structure of the wingtip, but I suspect they will be shown in my photos.  I thought this bird's tail was relatively short for a kingbird, but I had only an impression that the tail was about as long as the body without the head and neck.  I further thought the tail was relatively slim, parallel-sided, and with a square tip  though possibly with rounded corners.  The legs were slim and seemingly relatively short. This was a boldly marked bird with plumage patterns that contrasted blackish upperparts with white underparts.  More specifically, the head was mostly black, but with a sharply demarcated, white throat.  Although I noted that the throat was broadly white, suggesting that the white extended up through the submoustachial region to the lower edges of the moustachial and auricular regions, I did not specifically note the latter in the field.  Not only was the throat white, but the breast, belly, sides, and flanks were as well.  I did think there was some subtly darker smudging at the sides of the breast, but in general, the underparts were white.  My memory is less clear about the undertail coverts and the underside of the tail, but I think the former were white and the latter dark. My views of the upperparts were better than those of the underparts, but given the brevity of my observations when the bird was close resulted in my superficial impression of the patterns.  Overall, I thought the back, wings, and upperside of the tail were blackish, and I cannot really recall noticing in the field much contrast between the color on the back and the black of the head, wings, and tail, but it is still possible that the back was more of a slate-gray in color.  When I saw the bird at close range, the wings were obscured, at least in part because the bird was facing mostly away from me, but possibly also because the scapulars were covering part of the coverts.  As such, it was only when I saw this bird at a rather long distance that I could see at least some indication of a scaly pattern on the coverts that reflected narrow, but seemingly well-defined, tips of whitish to the median and greater coverts.  When seen at close range, I noted mostly that the innermost secondaries had relatively narrow, yet well-defined, and really rathe conspicuous edges of white to the innermost few secondaries.  I suspect the remaining remiges, or at least some of them, were likewise edged with white or whitish, but if so, these edges were narrower and less conspicuous.  The upperside of the tail was mostly black, but with a relatively broad band of white that extended straight across the tips of those feathers that I could see from above.  I thought the white band was well-defined and at least relatively straight, but I was unable to see to what degree the white extended inward along the edges of the feathers. I thought the bill was at least mostly dark, and also that the eyes were sufficiently dark to lack obvious contrast with the black plumage of the face.  The legs and feel likewise appeared to be dark, but I saw them only at a rather long distance and with the gray sky as a background, so I can probably only say with confidence that they were not obviously pale.",Tyrannus tyrannus,easkin,Species,17302,,4.25,4,,1447,2272

Esta vez, observe y fotografie a dos ejemplares. Su comportamiento era el siguiente; mientras uno se quedaba en lo alto de alguna rama, el otro salia a cazar insectos para luego turnarse y el que se alimentaba, se queda ahora en la rama y el otro que estaba posado, salia a cazar. Eso lo hacian recurrentemente. Cuando esto sucedia, Gorriones salian de entre las ramas ""correteando"" y molestando a los S. boreales pero estos no se quedaban ""ahi no mas"" y defendian con todo su territorio! Cuando nos retirabamos de la plaza, los dos se posaron en un arbusto bajo y logramos ver un comportamiento entre cortejo y juego (uno se subio arriba del otro y levantaba las alas). Desconozco la edad reproductiva pero uno, al parecer, aun es juvenil (OBS: ver imagen ya que aun se le nota la comisura del pico)",Tyrannus tyrannus,easkin,Species,17302,,4.67,3,,633,950

Highly contrasting kingbird with mostly black back. dark gray wings with pale edged primaries and coverts, black head (extending below the eyes and forming a rounded ""cheek""), black bill sized maybe a bit bigger than Cassin's, white throat, white breast with gray splotches, white belly, flanks, and vent, underwing coverts and axillaries on the paler side, white tail tips with one fresh rectrix (R2?) growing out and featuring a brighter white tip than the other rectrices. Pale undertail edges (but not thick white as in WEKI). Additional signs of molt on top of head. Lower mandible a bit pale at base and barely visible pale gape. Non-vocal. Photos to come.

Marantz on 11 June 2023 at the Pelican Point entrance to Crystal Cove State Park, Orange County, California.","Although this bird had been moving back-and-forth along the bluffs before I arrived, it flew to the northeast just as I walked up and landed in a small tree near the entrance kiosk.  We then spent a few minutes studying this bird and taking photographs before it flew off to the north across the Pacific Coast Highway and landed in one of the large eucalyptus trees on the north side of the road.  I saw the kingbird only briefly as it perched in the upper branches of this tree before it flew when I looked away.  Despite my expending much effort in search of the kingbird, I never did see this bird again.  As such, I managed to get good, yet relatively brief, views of this bird from behind when it perched atop the tree near the entrance kiosk, followed by rather distant views when it was in the tree across the road.  Much like other Eastern Kingbirds that I have seen in California, this bird was silent. this was a relatively large, heavy-bodied flycatcher that when seen fighting with a presumed Cassin's Kingbird appeared roughly similar in size and structure, though it may have had a shorter tail.  I noted that the bill was relatively short and tapering from a base of medium depth to what appeared to be a blunt tip along a culmen that was slightly decurved, but i did not compare the length relative to field-marks on the face.  The forehead was sloping and the crown seemed to be comparably sloped upward to what appeared to be a subtle peak above and behind the eye, all on a head that was a bit large for the bird's size.  the neck was short and stout, and the body was plump, full-chested, and with a roughly diagonal posture and the tail held downward in the plane of the body.  I failed to notice in the field both the primary projection and the length and structure of the wingtip, but I suspect they will be shown in my photos.  I thought this bird's tail was relatively short for a kingbird, but I had only an impression that the tail was about as long as the body without the head and neck.  I further thought the tail was relatively slim, parallel-sided, and with a square tip  though possibly with rounded corners.  The legs were slim and seemingly relatively short. This was a boldly marked bird with plumage patterns that contrasted blackish upperparts with white underparts.  More specifically, the head was mostly black, but with a sharply demarcated, white throat.  Although I noted that the throat was broadly white, suggesting that the white extended up through the submoustachial region to the lower edges of the moustachial and auricular regions, I did not specifically note the latter in the field.  Not only was the throat white, but the breast, belly, sides, and flanks were as well.  I did think there was some subtly darker smudging at the sides of the breast, but in general, the underparts were white.  My memory is less clear about the undertail coverts and the underside of the tail, but I think the former were white and the latter dark. My views of the upperparts were better than those of the underparts, but given the brevity of my observations when the bird was close resulted in my superficial impression of the patterns.  Overall, I thought the back, wings, and upperside of the tail were blackish, and I cannot really recall noticing in the field much contrast between the color on the back and the black of the head, wings, and tail, but it is still possible that the back was more of a slate-gray in color.  When I saw the bird at close range, the wings were obscured, at least in part because the bird was facing mostly away from me, but possibly also because the scapulars were covering part of the coverts.  As such, it was only when I saw this bird at a rather long distance that I could see at least some indication of a scaly pattern on the coverts that reflected narrow, but seemingly well-defined, tips of whitish to the median and greater coverts.  When seen at close range, I noted mostly that the innermost secondaries had relatively narrow, yet well-defined, and really rathe conspicuous edges of white to the innermost few secondaries.  I suspect the remaining remiges, or at least some of them, were likewise edged with white or whitish, but if so, these edges were narrower and less conspicuous.  The upperside of the tail was mostly black, but with a relatively broad band of white that extended straight across the tips of those feathers that I could see from above.  I thought the white band was well-defined and at least relatively straight, but I was unable to see to what degree the white extended inward along the edges of the feathers. I thought the bill was at least mostly dark, and also that the eyes were sufficiently dark to lack obvious contrast with the black plumage of the face.

Highly contrasting kingbird with mostly black back. dark gray wings with pale edged primaries and coverts, black head (extending below the eyes and forming a rounded ""cheek""), black bill sized maybe a bit bigger than Cassin's, white throat, white breast with gray splotches, white belly, flanks, and vent, underwing coverts and axillaries on the paler side, white tail tips with one fresh rectrix (R2?) growing out and featuring a brighter white tip than the other rectrices. Pale undertail edges (but not thick white as in WEKI). Additional signs of molt on top of head. Lower mandible a bit pale at base and barely visible pale gape. Non-vocal. Photos to come.

Fortunately, it was still around once I had a chance to grab my binoculars and observe it more carefully. Large flycatcher with white belly and dark back, with a dark cap bisecting the head.  As far as expected birds, the plumage pattern was similar to a drab Tree Swallow, but structurally it was entirely different with a much larger bill, shorter wings / longer tail, and just overall a larger, heftier bird.  When it flew, it displayed white tail tips at which point the ID clicked. Close inspection of photos taken at greater leisure later in the day show a faint gape flange and a bit of a brownish cast to the head and back suggesting a hatch year bird, which may help explain it being a bit off-course",Tyrannus tyrannus,easkin,Species,17302,,5.00,2,,3830,5111

Extracted from ESBirds post by Chris: At noon today (24 Aug 2009) I found an Eastern Kingbird east of Independence, flycatching in the alfalfa fields east of the woodlot. I first saw it when I flushed it from a fence.  It flew away and up and up and up and all I saw in those brief moments was a dark kingbird-sized bird with a contrasting white tail tip.  It disappeared in some trees half a mile away and I feared that would be the last I'd see of a 90% probable EAKI.  With luck I was able to relocate the bird and study it at close range (no camera in hand).  The bird was pale below, whitest in the throat, off-white down through belly to undertail coverts.  The sides of breast were smudgy gray.  The head was dark gray, nearly black around the eye, cleanly cut where the dark face meets the white throat around the gape.  The back was grayish brown with finely scalloped edges to the coverts (juvenile bird?). The tertials were boldly edged white.  The slightly notched, square-tipped tail was just as dark as the face (from above) and had anarrow off-white tail tip, much reduced from typical breeding plumagedbirds I've seen. At one point I got so close, I could see the gape was still flesh-colored, which confirmed my hunch it was a hatch-year bird.",Tyrannus tyrannus,easkin,Species,17302,,5.00,2,,887,903

This is my fourth viewing of this bird and the closest I’ve been to it, maybe twenty feet at times. The bird seemed more comfortable around other kingbirds, but was still wary of humans. Was able to follow it westward down fence line. Bird was mostly in and around paved loop, at times perching on fence, in trees, and on large flowering stalks. Seen flycatching and perching next to Western Kingbird and female Red-winged Blackbirds. I finally had better looks and hadn’t noticed the dark wash on chest until today though I’d seen it mentioned on another birder’s post, otherwise white underside and chin, and mostly coal and some brown on upperparts (wings, back head, nape).
