En mettant mes jumelles dessus pendant une fraction de seconde, je reconnais instantanément la silhouette d'un coulicou, avec ses ailes pointues et sa très longue queue. Je bondi du banc de parc où j'étais installé et je m'enfonce dans la forêt à l'est de la base de plein air, jusqu'à ce que j'entende des « kh-kh-kh-kh » vers la plage. Je dégringole la falaise à toute vitesse puis je marche le long de la plage vers l'est. Alors que je pensais l'avoir perdu, je le repère posé sur une branche dégagée, à la hauteur des yeux tout juste au bord de la plage. Grand oiseau au gros bec courbé vers le bas avec la mandibule inférieure jaune, grosse tête grise, gros oeil noir avec le tour jaune, bandeau sombre sur l'oeil, gorge, joue et ventre blancs, dos brun chaud, ailes rousses, longue queue noire avec des grosses taches blanches. Le coulicou a sauté de branches en branches dans les arbustes du bord de la plage durant quelques minutes puis j'ai quitté l'oiseau et suis retourné à mon poste. Revu une demi-heure plus tard alors qu'il surgit des buissons de la falaise, me passe à 2 m de la face et plonge dans la forêt derrière le belvédère en bois.",Coccyzus americanus,yebcuc,Species,3188,,4.95,22,,2747,4120

En mettant mes jumelles dessus pendant une fraction de seconde, je reconnais instantanément la silhouette d'un coulicou, avec ses ailes pointues et sa très longue queue. Je bondi du banc de parc où j'étais installé et je m'enfonce dans la forêt à l'est de la base de plein air, jusqu'à ce que j'entende des « kh-kh-kh-kh » vers la plage. Je dégringole la falaise à toute vitesse puis je marche le long de la plage vers l'est. Alors que je pensais l'avoir perdu, je le repère posé sur une branche dégagée, à la hauteur des yeux tout juste au bord de la plage. Grand oiseau au gros bec courbé vers le bas avec la mandibule inférieure jaune, grosse tête grise, gros oeil noir avec le tour jaune, bandeau sombre sur l'oeil, gorge, joue et ventre blancs, dos brun chaud, ailes rousses, longue queue noire avec des grosses taches blanches. Le coulicou a sauté de branches en branches dans les arbustes du bord de la plage durant quelques minutes puis j'ai quitté l'oiseau et suis retourné à mon poste. Revu une demi-heure plus tard alors qu'il surgit des buissons de la falaise, me passe à 2 m de la face et plonge dans la forêt derrière le belvédère en bois.",Coccyzus americanus,yebcuc,Species,3188,,4.83,6,,2616,3924

Grand oiseau au gros bec courbé vers le bas avec la mandibule inférieure jaune, grosse tête grise, gros oeil noir avec le tour jaune, bandeau sombre sur l'oeil, gorge, joue et ventre blancs, dos brun chaud, ailes rousses, longue queue noire avec des grosses taches blanches. Le coulicou a sauté de branches en branches dans les arbustes du bord de la plage durant quelques minutes puis j'ai quitté l'oiseau et suis retourné à mon poste.

We believe that their migration has been affected by Hurricane Delta.  Other birdlife members have observed them in large numbers, one member counted 123 the day before we visited the area and shared the location with birdlife members.  We travelled a couple of miles along two roads in the Portmore area and every 50 meters or so we flushed another 4 to 6 birds out of underbrush.  100 is an estimate based on the approximately 20 stops and 4-6 birds each time plus many flying overhead.  There were probably much more than 100 in the area.

After several moments, it went into the elderberry bush and climbed around, occasionally poking it’s head out. Finally the cuckoo climbed to the exterior of the elderberry and took a sunbath. Bird was in full view at least 12 minutes.

Seemed interested in my presence considering they are shy birds. Second cuckoo out of frame.","First noted a Yellow-billed Cuckoo in late June by it's knocking repetitious call over in the northeast side of Jessie Lake. Paddled over and it flew directly to west bay. Paddled over and thought two Cuckoos flew overhead back to east side. Paddled back and waited until I was able to verify by call and sight. However, only observed one; so did not record two until I returned July 4th and 5th. Definitely a pair forging in scrub along the lake. Would then fly up into the canopy of trees. At first glance, they resemble a mourning dove in flight but wings are pointed. The long slender body and the long tail with white contrasting oval pattern dictates Cuckoo. The posture and bill also depicts whether it is a Cuckoo and the variety; in this case, Yellow-billed Cuckoo. I was not able to capture both Cuckoos together in one photo. They continued to remain in this location for weeks after. Still monitoring.",Coccyzus americanus,yebcuc,Species,3188,,4.33,3,Habitat,2668,4001

This was about 100 yards west of where the habitat removal was being done by the City's landscaping contractor.  The bird looked a bit stressed (at least how it struck me), as it flushed barely above me (maybe 12-15' initially), and then just perched there, pretty much completely in the open, only 20' above me, looking back towards the area where workers were clearing vegetation. Not all that typical behavior for a YBCU in my experience.

The calling continued for several minutes until finally i heard it much clearer almost as if it were directly above me. So i looked up and there was my first look at a YBCK, what stuck out to me was how long the tailfeathers were. The underside of the bird was very white, and the bird was overall slender. Then i saw its bill the underside was yellow of course and long, so i knew this is no dove. I aimed my camera up and it was gone but continued to vocalize. Then it popped up briefly again thats when i took a few pics and then it ventured further back into the shrubs.",Coccyzus americanus,yebcuc,Species,3188,,5.00,2,,2890,4343

I watched as the bird called emphatically. I was trying to get a photo when the bird flew off to my right. It was instantly replaced by a bird that flew in from the left and perched in the same spot. This bird had a long piece of plant fiber in its mouth and began turning its head from left to right, dipping the fiber as it turned. The bird did this for what seemed a minute or two. The first Cuckoo called, flew in with what I believe was a worm in its mouth and they began to copulate. I don't know what happened to the plant fiber after that, but the two held on to the worm together as they coupled. This went on for several minutes without them parting. I finally had to move to allow traffic by me. When I returned to the spot I couldn't see them. No matter, as I moved up the road, one flew in and landed. Almost immediately, the second flew in and they coupled very briefly and the second one flew off. This is what I am used to seeing. I have never before seen this prolonged coupling for several minutes. It was quite an experience to watch. It went on so long I took 25 shots of the process, but I will only be able to add ten.",Coccyzus americanus,yebcuc,Species,3188,,5.00,2,,2259,3025

The first bird was initially seen along Swamp/Creek Path about 20 ft past the wooden footbridge. The low light conditions due to the clouds at first only allowed me to see movement, not realizing the size of the bird considering at first I thought it was a warbler or vireo. Once I got binoculars on it, my shock still couldn’t mask what was in front of me; the long tail, decurved yellow beak, dark back, and pale undersides were obvious indicators of YBCU. I glanced down at my phone and when I looked back up the bird was gone, but thankfully it moved to a nearby branch where I soon relocated it. It made one of its rail-like calls which was nice to here. And then, in cryptic cuckoo fashion, it disappeared. I searched for a few minutes and remarkably saw it in flight feeding in the high tree tops. As it landed, o noticed movement elsewhere, which I once again was warbler activity, but was dumbfounded when I saw a SECOND cuckoo! These two bird were obviously a mated pair as they began to feed together and were inseparable once I noticed both together. They remained in the high canopy and never descended. Amazingly tough to see despite their size (and the weather conditions weren’t helping). FOS for me and FOY for Hillside. The date indicates a migrant though I wouldn’t be surprised if they bred here (nor this year though, I’m certain of that!).",Coccyzus americanus,yebcuc,Species,3188,,5.00,2,,1867,2800

The Cuckoos were seen in our treetops (primarily in our 2 willow trees) over more than a 4-hour period. Initially, 3 were seen: 1 Black-billed and 2 Yellow-billed in the first 20 minutes. As the afternoon/evening progressed, only the Yellow-billed Cuckoos were seen, and generally, one was found at a time, making it hard to count them. After comprehensively studying our 230 photos shot throughout this period, I am of the opinion, due to specific unique characteristics of individuals, that we likely had a total of 4 or more Yellow-billed, but I am conservatively claiming only 3 in case I have erred in my estimations. I shot video of one as prey was captured and eaten, so I have included 2 screenshots from that video.",Coccyzus americanus,yebcuc,Species,3188,,3.75,4,,648,864

A tad late as well with the majority of these birds passing through Southern Westchester by late September (though they continue in very small numbers into October).   As Landing birds tend to come, this birds discovery was very fortuitous, with a special line-up of events leading to the find. After the Prairie flew towards the thickets on the far side of the flats, I initially decided that I wouldn’t try to relocate it, but in a last minute change of heart, I went anyway as there wasn’t a lot of bird activity. I reached the thickets and roped around seeing nothing. I then positioned myself adjacent to the thickets to get a better view of the river. Yet while in this spot, a previously parked truck decided to pull out and then back-up into the exact spot I was standing.   This move on the part of the driver seemed to be quite aggressive (can’t explain why however). Yet in hindsight, I’m quite thankful for this incident as it motivated me to walk along the rocky shoreline bordering the thickets instead of the gravel road on the other side. Making my way back to the flats, I had completely forgotten about the Prairie when I flushed a bird that had been at the base of the thickets.   As it flew away from me, I noted the birds large size, longe tail, brownish coloration, and tapered, rufous wings. Having looked at Bob Lewis’ gorgeous flight shot of YBCU at Rockefeller dozens of times, I immediately knew this was a YBCU despite the wacky habitat and brief views. Truthfully, had I not been convinced of YBCU from the get-go, the habitat alone would’ve discouraged this ID.   Thankfully, I knew which tree the bird had landed in, and after dismounting the slippery rocks, I was able to scour the tree. In typical cuckoo fashion, it took me quite a few minutes to spot this bird (the fall foliage definitely didn’t help to spotlight it!). Perched, all the flagship features of this species were seen, notably its yellow, decurved beak. Additional features not seen in first looks included: white chest, flanks, and UTCs, yellow “eyering,” and white spots on underside of tail. I was able to enjoy this bird’s presence for about 10 minutes before it slinked away.   Personally, I’m not sure whether I enjoyed the story behind the bird or the actual bird more (who am I kidding, it’s a YBCU, so definitely the bird!).

The first bird was initially seen along Swamp/Creek Path about 20 ft past the wooden footbridge. The low light conditions due to the clouds at first only allowed me to see movement, not realizing the size of the bird considering at first I thought it was a warbler or vireo. Once I got binoculars on it, my shock still couldn’t mask what was in front of me; the long tail, decurved yellow beak, dark back, and pale undersides were obvious indicators of YBCU. I glanced down at my phone and when I looked back up the bird was gone, but thankfully it moved to a nearby branch where I soon relocated it. It made one of its rail-like calls which was nice to here. And then, in cryptic cuckoo fashion, it disappeared. I searched for a few minutes and remarkably saw it in flight feeding in the high tree tops. As it landed, o noticed movement elsewhere, which I once again was warbler activity, but was dumbfounded when I saw a SECOND cuckoo! These two bird were obviously a mated pair as they began to feed together and were inseparable once I noticed both together. They remained in the high canopy and never descended. Amazingly tough to see despite their size (and the weather conditions weren’t helping). FOS for me and FOY for Hillside. The date indicates a migrant though I wouldn’t be surprised if they bred here (nor this year though, I’m certain of that!).",Coccyzus americanus,yebcuc,Species,3188,,4.50,2,,1953,2930

I watched as the bird called emphatically. I was trying to get a photo when the bird flew off to my right. It was instantly replaced by a bird that flew in from the left and perched in the same spot. This bird had a long piece of plant fiber in its mouth and began turning its head from left to right, dipping the fiber as it turned. The bird did this for what seemed a minute or two. The first Cuckoo called, flew in with what I believe was a worm in its mouth and they began to copulate. I don't know what happened to the plant fiber after that, but the two held on to the worm together as they coupled. This went on for several minutes without them parting. I finally had to move to allow traffic by me. When I returned to the spot I couldn't see them. No matter, as I moved up the road, one flew in and landed. Almost immediately, the second flew in and they coupled very briefly and the second one flew off. This is what I am used to seeing. I have never before seen this prolonged coupling for several minutes. It was quite an experience to watch. It went on so long I took 25 shots of the process, but I will only be able to add ten.",Coccyzus americanus,yebcuc,Species,3188,,4.50,2,,2967,3680

White below, decurved bill (backlit, bill color not readily distinguishable inflight), and long tail w/ large white spots. Backlighting showed distinct reddish color to the flight feathers. First bird crossed over the river to the western bank and steadily moved south toward site, continually singing. Reached the launch and sang in silver maples overhanging the river for several minutes, often in view (though almost only from within the canopy). Bill clearly bicolored and predominantly yellow. Observed singing behavior where the bird bobbed/stooped with each “coo” note. First bird was observed carrying a small green caterpillar for several minutes, even singing with caterpillar in its bill (did not observe the bird eating the caterpillar or feeding to the other bird). For a span of 30-45 seconds, both birds were in the same silver maple at which point the singing bird sang a shorter, softer “coo” song (interaction?). Second bird gave short harsh call, but no interaction beyond this was observed as the birds were partially obscured, each on separate branches.

We were watching an elderberry bush which was hosting many birds (thrashers, tanagers, verdin, finches). I suddenly noticed a cuckoo sitting quietly to one side. After several moments, it went into the elderberry bush and climbed around, occasionally poking it’s head out. Finally the cuckoo climbed to the exterior of the elderberry and took a sunbath. Bird was in full view at least 12 minutes. Later in the morning we observed a bird pulling caterpillars off the elderberry leaves and I would guess that was what attracted the cuckoo although we did not observe it eat anything.

Ka-ka-ka-ka-kauwp contact calls heard from this bird twice. Photos. Perched in eucalyptus where it preened and scratched. It then moved to an ash tree where after moving around for a time eventually sat motionless for about 45 minutes or more (the ash is non-native Shamel Ash, Fraxinus uhdei, according to L. Ballard). Central tail appeared worn (these often more worn due to exposure but also might have been replaced last summer followed by suspended molt with remaining rectrices replaced on winter grounds, per P. Pyle). Oddly, this bird was scolded by a mixed species flock of chickadees, titmice, hummingbirds, Black Phoebe, and maybe Hooded Oriole and Pacific-slope Flycatcher curious too. Libby Patten found the bird by following the sound of Wrentits scolding the cuckoo. This species is both an intraspecific and interspecific (very rarely, e.g. R-wg Blackbird and doves) nest parasite and may elicit scolding in areas where it breeds. It seems odd that these local birds would scold a cuckoo. Perhaps the shape suggest a predator, e.g. Sharp-shinned Hawk or jay (similar shapes).  A medium-large bird (perhaps similar to Aphelocoma jay) but with a longer tail that showed prominent white spots at tips of rectrices. Brownish-gray dorsally with browner wings that when spread (seen in flight and during wing stretch) showed rufous red in primaries. Underparts from chin to crissum soft white. Slaty patch/lying behind eye somewhat vague. Orbital ring skin not noted in the field (not prominent). Bill was orange-yellow on mandible and perhaps lower maxilla. Culmen and dorsal portion of maxilla blackish, this extending to the tip where crossing over to tip of mandible. [Photos show orbital ring to be dull grayish with tinges of dull yellow.] This bird scratched its head with foot directly forward (""underwing"").  Rare in Santa Barbara Co. and coastal s.

AJB photos. We had been having a great run with Black-billed Cuckoos while setting autonomous recording devices for them in mature riparian habitat (having just detected our 5th and 6th individuals counter-singing at the prior point) and after AJB thought he heard a YBCU faintly the other day, we had hope that we would luck into one. As we were tromping through willows, I caught the end of a “Klowp” call series over the noise of our hiking and immediately called out Yellow-billed Cuckoo. Moving cautiously out of the willows, we entered an open meadow patch with mature cottonwoods. Andy spotted the cuckoo in the cottonwood closest to the willows about 50 meters away. Even through the mottled shade of the cottonwood, we saw the *pearly* white breast, crisp yellow bill (when the light hit it), and hint of a dark mask. As Andy approached to get a photo, *two* individual cuckoos flushed from the tree and went low into a stand of willows. In flight, we saw bold rufous throughout the primaries on classic cuckoo body—very long-tailed with long, pointed wings that have a hint of green-bronze iridescence on the coverts (reminding me of this photo from a prior study in flight). We connected with the cuckoos again after setting the recording devices; one responded to a bit of playback with another klowp call series, and we relocated it in another cottonwood tree at the edge of the mature forest. As Andy was photographing the bird in the tree, I saw the second burst to and from a patch of willows, flying low across the ground. The habitat here was excellent— a mature riparian forest with many felled cottonwoods (annoying you clamber over) that created an open, savanna-like woodland and had high butterfly abundance/diversity (which the cuckoos may be taking advantage of). ***Please do NOT use playback if trying for this bird! It will mess up the recording data for monitoring the status of this species in the area. Thank you!***",Coccyzus americanus,yebcuc,Species,3188,,3.67,3,,2210,2860

I watched as the bird called emphatically. I was trying to get a photo when the bird flew off to my right. It was instantly replaced by a bird that flew in from the left and perched in the same spot. This bird had a long piece of plant fiber in its mouth and began turning its head from left to right, dipping the fiber as it turned. The bird did this for what seemed a minute or two. The first Cuckoo called, flew in with what I believe was a worm in its mouth and they began to copulate. I don't know what happened to the plant fiber after that, but the two held on to the worm together as they coupled. This went on for several minutes without them parting. I finally had to move to allow traffic by me. When I returned to the spot I couldn't see them. No matter, as I moved up the road, one flew in and landed. Almost immediately, the second flew in and they coupled very briefly and the second one flew off. This is what I am used to seeing. I have never before seen this prolonged coupling for several minutes. It was quite an experience to watch. It went on so long I took 25 shots of the process, but I will only be able to add ten.",Coccyzus americanus,yebcuc,Species,3188,,4.00,2,,2787,3506
