In initial scan of lake I noticed a bird that, unaided by magnification, appeared to be some sort of goose hybrid. In fact, it was a BAEA lying prostrate on the water with wings flattened on the surface like pontoons. After a few seconds remaining relatively motionless, the eagle began to propel itself forward and lift off from the water. Clutched in its talons was a male COME. It was able to lift the bird almost completely out of the water before falling back to the surface with the merganser still underneath. After several more attempts to take off, the eagle lost its grip and made repeated tries to recapture the merganser. The COME was able to successfully dive and evade until the eagle departed to the shoreline and the merganser swam away toward its flock.

Judging by its deep gape and large head it appears to be the female. When I first saw the nest it showed no evidence of any occupants. However as soon as the adult landed on a branch next to the nest two eaglets pop their heads up. They did not beg for food. The adult remained roosting to the right of the nest. At 8:48 AM one adult flew over the nest from south. Then the female flew to occupy the usual roost in the large tree at the corner of 208 and Pines to the east. I’m continuing to watch the Nest but there has been no activity. they did not vocalize which seemed unusual. I found the female roosting in the usual spot and obtain photos. I returned to the nest and once again did not catch sight of the eaglets. I failed to get any photos of the eaglets although I did see both at once. The female disgorged a pellet which I photographed.,Haliaeetus leucocephalus,baleag,Species,8271,,4.67,3,,1909,2545

When we arrived at the golf course, we spotted the eagle circling over the first two side by side ponds.  It flew out towards middle road, before circling back around. We followed it to number 17 pond, where it landed high up in a Norfolk pine tree. It sat there for about 5 minutes before flying low across the pond, trying to catch mallards.  It then flew across the course and landed on one of the large poles, and sat up there for at least ten minutes (Note: Tropicbird remains were found beneath these poles earlier today).   After watching it for a bit, it flew back across to 17, where it landed back in the same pine tree.  After that it chased a few ducks in the air, and then flew back over towards the first two ponds.  The crows spotted it and chased it back towards Morgan's Point.  Overall the eagle stayed on the course for about an hour, and had also been seen earlier that day.  The course was closed to golfers, so the eagle was likely taking advantage of this.",Haliaeetus leucocephalus,baleag,Species,8271,,4.20,5,,2805,3419

The crows started to harass it as usual, flying over from Morgan’s towards it. It didn’t seem bothered by them at all, flying over the the coastline of Morgan’s, where it skimmed the water ad snagged a fish with its talons. Then flew up into one of the casuarinas where we located it again using a scope. It ate for about 20 or more minutes before eventually hopping up onto a higher branch where it was in full view. We were joined by David and a few others who also saw it at this point. After a while it flew up into some higher casuarinas to then right of the dead tree it was in yesterday. The crows returned and started mobbing it again, at one point at least five if them were sitting in the tree surrounding it.

One adult eagle perched for awhile in a high tree near the western end of the lake. Three immature eagles flew in from the direction of the Potomac River to the eastern end of the lake and continued west.  At the end of my visit, I saw one adult in the company of an immature eagle fly out of the forested interior of the state park, pass over the parking area near the C&O Canal bridge, and continue on in the direction of the lake. The eagles have been reported previously by multiple observers.   At one point, the three immature eagles that flew in together circled each other playfully in the air, calling as they did.  One distinctive eagle, with a mostly white head and abundant white on the body, made a failed attempt at fishing in the lake. [It has a rather ghostly appearance in gray light, therefore I call it the ""phantom"" for reference in my notes.]  Two brown-headed immature eagles came in close to me, circling directly above, as if studying me, before flying off to a distant part of the lake. This has occurred on each of my last three visits where I saw eagles.",Haliaeetus leucocephalus,baleag,Species,8271,,4.33,3,,1596,2400

I took a series of shots of it flapping it's wings and lifting off only up a few feet and for a few seconds. (It did not have prey in its talons.)  It ended up in the middle of a flock of American White Pelicans. They scattered when the eagle was lunging forward but then they would come back and observe it. The photos are distant and over exposed. I plan to go back tomorrow to see if it is still stuck there. I stopped at the bridge and took some shots from there so that I could inspect its physical appearance more closely but could not see anything obviously wrong.

You can see (her) looking to her right, which is where I believe her mate was. Even thoughI couldn't see her mate,  think she knew right where he was. One of the other photos shows the (female) Bald Eagle with her beak open making her loud call to the mate, I assume because she wants food. It seemed clear that the male could hear her calls because the other adult (I assume the male) did a fly by “check in,” with the vocalizing (female) adult who was still sitting on the branch watching him do the ""fly by check in"" The (female) Eagle on the branch,  had just been sitting on the nest with the eggs. The flying (male) adult had no food to deliver, he just came close to the female adult, to check in and let her know he was working on it, and then flew back to the lake to hunt some more. At least I assume that was what was being communicated between the two eagles based on their body postures and vocalizations. In the one photo of the (female) Eagle looking down, she is looking directly at the eggs inside the nest. To me that is why she didn't leave to get her own food. The crow activity around here is fierce, I have seen a flock of crows attack a raptor and pull it's feathers, so I don't think a nesting eagle would leave her  eggs unattended with so many crows around. Of course I am reading a lot into what I am seeing, but that is my best surmise of what is going on here at this Bald Eagle Nest right now.

You can see (her) looking to her right, which is where I believe her mate was. Even thoughI couldn't see her mate,  think she knew right where he was. One of the other photos shows the (female) Bald Eagle with her beak open making her loud call to the mate, I assume because she wants food. It seemed clear that the male could hear her calls because the other adult (I assume the male) did a fly by “check in,” with the vocalizing (female) adult who was still sitting on the branch watching him do the ""fly by check in"" The (female) Eagle on the branch,  had just been sitting on the nest with the eggs. The flying (male) adult had no food to deliver, he just came close to the female adult, to check in and let her know he was working on it, and then flew back to the lake to hunt some more. At least I assume that was what was being communicated between the two eagles based on their body postures and vocalizations. In the one photo of the (female) Eagle looking down, she is looking directly at the eggs inside the nest. To me that is why she didn't leave to get her own food.
